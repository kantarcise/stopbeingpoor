[Social Proof Flywheel: How To Use Social Proof To Sign More Clients & Make More Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=386ncFwz7B0) - 10 April 2023


### How to Get and Use Social Proof to Sign More Clients

Hey lads — today we're talking about how to **get and use social proof** to sign more clients.

I'm **Daniel Fazio**. I currently employ 26 people and earn anywhere between $250K–$400K per month across various companies: software, marketing agency work, and of course, [Client Ascension](https://clientascension.com), where we **guarantee** that you'll add $10K/month in new business — or you don’t pay. Specifically for marketing agencies and B2B businesses.

### What We’ll Cover Today

* How to create **case study machines**
* How **not** to use social proof
* How to **get proof as a beginner**

### Why Social Proof Is the Growth Engine

Your company will grow **in direct proportion** to the amount of **quantifiable social proof** you have.

#### My Proof Examples

* **Chandler** — $3.5M after rejoining Client Ascension
* **Dylan** — $42K/month in 5 months
* **Colin** — $100K/month
* **Sam** — $55K/month
* **Michael** — $80K/month
* **Scott** — $33K/month
* **Kyle** — $70K/month

*Note: These are outdated. They’ve all grown significantly more since.*

This is the kind of social proof that works:

> Client → Result → Specific \$\$ Quantification

Your business should operate like this:

```
Client → Case Study → Client → Case Study → ...
```

If you sign a client and don’t get results, you miss the opportunity to generate proof that attracts the next one.

### Proof vs Guarantee — Which Is More Powerful?

If you could only have one, **proof beats guarantee**.

Quantifiable case studies improve every metric:

* Cold email response rates
* Call booking rates
* Close rates
* How much you can charge

So instead of asking:

> "How do I boost my cold email performance?"

Ask:

> "How can I generate proof of results?"
 
**Proof** makes everything easier — even pricing.

### Proof Justifies Your Price

If you charge $3K and have a case study showing a client made $42K, that price is **reasonable**.

If you charge $20K and made a client $1M? Still reasonable.

But if your only case study says your client made \$5K and you charge \$3K? That’s a **hard sell**.

Your ability to charge more is directly tied to the **depth** of your proof — **not** just how many case studies you have.

### How *Not* to Use Social Proof

Most people mess this up.

#### What Not to Do:

* “We increased leads by 32%.”
* “We reduced CPL by 27%.”
* “Loved working with them!”

These are useless. They don’t tell a clear story or show **tangible results**.

You must show: **Did the client make money or achieve a concrete result?**

#### Important Caveat:

Sometimes **money isn’t the result** clients want.

Example: I used to run an Instagram growth agency. Fitness coaches didn’t care about revenue — they only wanted more **followers**.

Know your audience.

### Present Proof the Right Way

Every action you want a lead to take needs to come with **a reason**.

Don’t just write a case study and title it with the client’s name. Use a **bold headline** that communicates the result.

#### Example:

Bad: **John Smith** “Helped him scale”

Good: **"How Chandler Hit $3.5M in Sales with Client Ascension"**

The headline = the **outcome**
The name = **subtext**

Always lead with what matters: the **result**.

### Case Study Structure Example

Here’s what mine look like on the sales page:

* **How Chandler hit $3.5M in sales inside Client Ascension**
* **How Sam built a $55K/month TikTok agency**
* **How Kyle hit $70K/month** *(he’s now at \$140K!)*

### How to Get Proof as a Beginner

It typically takes **6–8 months** to see traction.

Why? Because it takes that long to get your first solid case study.

> Your business & client acquisition will immediately & indistinguishably start moving extraordinarily faster at the exact moment you produce your first good case study.

When you are a beginner, you need to take what you can get.

You don't have the luxury of charging people $5,000 - $10,000 and putting them on 6 month contracts when you have precisely zero proof.

Proof is the **flywheel**.

Once you have it, momentum builds.

#### Common Mistake:

You try to charge $5K–$10K/month with no proof.

You hear the internet hype:

> “Be a growth partner. Take rev share. Agencies are dead.”

No. That doesn’t work **unless you can prove** your work.

### Signing a Client for Free? Set Clear Intentions

If you're working with a client for free, make this 100% clear:

> “I am doing this *only* for a case study. You agree to share metrics, sales numbers, and results.”

Otherwise, you’re wasting your time.

### Why Most Businesses Fail

You’ve heard this:

> “90% of businesses fail.”

Why? Because they don’t last long enough to:

* Build competence
* Deliver results
* Create case studies
* Earn social proof

That all happens after **month 6**.

### Summary: Stop Giving Up, Start Building Proof

If you want to succeed:

* Get competent
* Serve real clients
* Turn those results into **quantifiable case studies**
* Repeat

And if you’re already doing \$5K+/month in your agency or B2B business — and want us to help you add **$10K/month in profit or you don’t pay**:
