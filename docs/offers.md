# Offers

## Definition

From this [banger tweet](https://x.com/blackhatwizardd/status/1849157663398965449).

An **offer** is a set of deliverables that help a client reach a specific quantifiable goal.

"Sign 10 clients in the next month with cold email" is an offer.

"Increase your revenue by a minimum of $25k/mo with our email flows" is an offer.

It's an "offer" when the facilitation of it can lead to an end goal.

You need to do one clear thing, for one clear person, with one clear outcome and one clear risk reversal with one clear evidence that you are able to do that.

What you do, who you serve, what the terms are?

## Offer Formulation

    This is Video #23 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

- **Specific Problem**

- **Unique Mechanism**

- **Pricing / Terms**

- **Risk Reversal**

!!! tip

    Solve a problem **big enough**. That's the most important part here. See [offer positioning](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#offer-positioning)

### Specific Problem

1. Specific Problem (Most Important)

If the problem is big enough, nothing else matters.

Example: If someone has cancer with six months to live, the price, terms, or guarantees of a treatment are secondary to the possibility of solving the problem.

You must find the actual pressing problem a niche is facing, not make it up.

**Mistake to Avoid**:

- Starting from a skill (copywriting, FB ads) and trying to reverse-engineer an offer.

- Correct approach: Start from the problem, then build the unique mechanism, pricing/terms, and risk reversal.

You can get away with not solving a specific problem and a unique mechanism like this:

- "I'll front the cost of your facebook advertising. I'll write the copy, make the ads and use my own ad account. You give me 20% of the deals that close"

This will NOT work:

- "I charge $3000 to manage your Facebook ads"

Instead, let's just find the specific problem. 😎

Examples:

- [Hyros](https://hyros.com/) - Ad attribution with pixels is horrible and doesn't work. Fixes this with %98 accuracy. (Current headline: *"Track more sales. Feed to AI. Scale further. HYROS is a patented AI attribution & AI system that on average increases ad scale by 20% across over 3000+ clients*)

- [Cole Gordon](https://closers.io/): You're not getting enough calls from your opt ins. Places appointment setter in your business to call the leads. (Current headline: *We help businesses find proven salespeople, ramp them into KPI, and systematize management so they can work on their business, not in it.*)

So, how to find specific problems?

**Answer**: ***Source it from the niche you have in your head (in an actually human way)***

Let's say the niche you've chosen is SaaS companies who just raised some money.

In Email - Twitter - Linkedin - Instagram:

> Hey {{name}}, I'm thinking about starting up an agency or a service company of some sort, and thought of SaaS companies as a niche.

> What problems do you guys actually have? I don't want to sit here and make something up, I want to solve a real problem.

You are talking to a human.

The more individualization the more response rates.

### Unique Mechanism

You need to turn the "thing" you are selling into a system.

This is your "special way" you do something. If you frame your "special way" as ACTUALLY special, and display you are capable of delivering abnormally good results, you can charge more money.

**Example**: An email copywriter:

**Question**: "What makes you good at at email marketing?" 

**His Answer**:

- Coaching/Info product owners make a huge mistake with their email list.

- All they do is pitch pitch pitch "book a call book a call book a call "

- Nobody shows any personality. Any cold traffic that comes in will immediately unsubscribe from email list. You burn the lead forever.

- You need to play the long game. Not everybody knows who you are and you have to show them your personality on the email list.

- But most people don't know how to write copy correctly, let alone have the time to sit down and write it.

- I get on interviews with my clients. Almost like a therapist, I ask them questions and dig deep. I hypnotize myself into becoming them. And I write emails that show their personality and are completely indistinguishable from them actually writing.

You see: "High Income Skill" -> "Unique System"

**Example**: Client Ascension Provides the service for people to turn their offer into a unique system.

The Ascension Scaling System.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![The Client Ascension Way](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/ca_pipeline.png)
  <figcaption>The Client Ascension Way</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! warning 

    This might be updated now.

- People think they need to spend a lot of money or get investment money to have a successful business. They think there is no way you can hit $50000 without the help of VC's or access to industry secrets.

- We make it easy for them by:

    - Writing cold email scripts

    - Giving them the software for free

    - Giving them 3000 leads to send their cold emails to

    - Giving them Tweet templates & engagement

    - Twitter message scripts

    - Linkedin message scripts

    - Turning their offer to high ticket offer

    - Guaranteeing they add an Minimum $10k/mo in MRR or they don't pay.

That's a strong offer if I ever seen one.

### Pricing / Terms

How much you charge.

**Performative Offer**:

- Achieve specific quantifiable results
- Ad agencies

**Productized Service**:

- Based solely on deliverables
- Quantifiable results not dependent on you

For detailed explanation on this, see [Make Money Online](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#make-money-online).


You want **sophisticated buyers**. The more you charge the easier it is.

!!! tip

    If you are talking to a large company it's strange to not charge large amount of money.

    The association is that you do not know what you are doing.

    Specific problem and the unique mechanism. The pricing becomes semi inconsequential.

If you are a beginner, you have no idea what to charge.

You are going to have a hard time operating a sales call. (see video [ROI Calculator](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#roi-calculator))

If you are a beginner, you can charge a performance basis. This is not just for the clients it's **also for you**.

Daniel recommends a [60 percent margin for profits](https://youtu.be/opE6MRW9Ceg?t=738).

> You need to charge enough money to people where you could outsource/hire and still profit.

**High Ticket vs Low Ticket**

This might seem astronomically far away, but it's not.

Even if you are doing the thing, there is still an amount of effort that must be exerted to get the client the deliverable.

Here is an example 

!!! example

    Here is a pricing mistake.

    **Offer**: 60 short form pieces of content edited and 4 long form Youtube Videos Edited.

    **Price**: $2000

    This wouldn't be so bad if it was just the 60 pieces of short form content. But with the 4 long from Youtube Videos thrown in this becomes an unsustainable disaster. 

    There is no way this guy could ever sign another client at that pricing again.

    It would be **logistically impossible** to grow this company. The profit margin would be so thin. It would be so much work with so little pay.

Here is how the future might look with this mistake:

!!! warning

    When you do not charge enough money:

    - You don't have free cashflow to invest back into the business (your business is how you actually survive, eat and pay rent)

    - You don't have time to market and get more clients

    - You are miserable working so much, so you don't want to get more clients in the first place.

    - You burn out and your business goes to $0.

    - You think you are a failure but it was really just one mistake. You didn't charge enough money.

Don't let your business fail because you are too afraid to say a higher price on the phone.

Simultaneously, your pricing should be reasonable based on the value you can provide.

**Pricing a Performative Offer**:

- Should be around 5x return on investment (profit) if direct ROI

**Pricing a Productized Service**

Here is the equation:

> Pricing = Relative Perception + Value Add

**Relative Perception**: "You are a video editor. What do video editors normally get paid?"

**Value Add** = "This guy has this incredibly unique system that he uses that sounds really promising. That's definitely worth something."

The **better unique mechanism** you have, the **higher you can charge**. See the [ROI Calculator](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#roi-calculator).

### Risk Reversal

Risk Reversal is an **amplifier**.

It only comes after you have a specific problem and a unique mechanism. 

Types of risk reversals:

1. You don't pay until it works
2. You pay as it works (performance based agencies)
3. If it doesn't work you don't pay
4. If it doesn't work we'll work with you until it does.

You cannot do 1. Just do 2 or 3 when you get to that stage!

## Offer Positioning

!!! tip

    This is Video #19 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Offer Positioning: How to Get More Clients for your Agency or B2B Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uai8ZqWMmc)
 - 12 December 2022

### Introduction

There's a huge problem in the make money online space or anyone watching business tutorial videos.

It starts with this idea: learn a high-income skill and then sell that skill to businesses for money.

But here's the truth — nobody wants to give you access to their email list or their ads manager just so you can outsource it to a $4/hour VA.

They’re scared. Scared you’ll ruin their reputation or waste tens of thousands on ads.

### Understanding Fear for Better Offers

Let’s pause. Those two fears are your entry point:

1. Ruining their brand/reputation
2. Wasting ad budget

Use this exact language in your offer positioning.

### Questions You Must Answer

Ask these before selling:

* What have they tried that didn’t work?
* Did they buy a course from a fake guru?
* Did they lose $20k on ads?
* Who is the exact buyer?
* What are they afraid of?
* What will happen if they don’t solve the problem now?

**Warning:** Don’t make up answers. Get the exact syntax from real prospects.

### Example 1: Security Guard Training

A client in Client Ascension trained security guards to be more aware.

Initial offer: "We train guards to be more aware."

But that’s not the real buyer. It’s the security company owner. Why would they buy?

**After investigation:**

* Untrained guards = more violent incidents
* That leads to:

  1. Increased insurance rates or dropped coverage
  2. Brand damage
  3. Higher churn = more hiring costs

**Final offer:**

> Started at: "We train security guards to be more aware."

> Now: "Security company owners: We show you how to lower insurance rates, protect brand reputation, and reduce employee churn."

### Example 2: Client Ascension’s Own Offer

Every person who joins is asked:

* Why did you join?
* What motivated you to take the call?
* What was the breaking point?

These questions will help Daniel to word the offer for the people at the top of the funnel.

Genius.

And:

* Read real sales objections
* Collect sales team notes

Use these angles to translate into marketing.

**Data from prospects:**

* Tried ads and lost $30k
* Bought broken coaching products
* Tried cold email and failed (low replies, bad conversions)

**Fears:**

* Relying on agencies
* Going back to 9–5
* Needing VC funding to stay afloat

### Final Value Prop Example

> "B2B companies, agencies, consultants, and freelancers: We show you how to turn 100% cold prospects into paying customers — without wasting thousands on ads or relying on outside agencies."

### Injecting Speed & Certainty

**Speed:**

* We write your scripts
* Give 500 leads free
* Sending tool = free
* Sending cold emails by week 2
* Sales calls by week 3

**Certainty:**

* Guaranteed results
* Show other clients getting results now

### Call to Action

Want to see how it works?

1. Visit [clientascension.com](https://clientascension.com)
2. Watch the next video: How to Make Money Online

### Summary:

Start off by getting these questions answered from your prospects:

1. What did they try, and what didn't work?

2. Did they buy a course?

3. Did they try the thing the thing you're selling and it didn't work?

4. Who's the exact person buying it?

5. What are they scared of?

6. What is going to happen to them if they don't solve this specific problem?

Get it from the people who you are selling to.

Here is a banger example from CA:

Start with: ***"We Train Security Guards to be more aware"***

End with: ***"Security Company Owners: We show you how to keep your insurance rates low, keep your brand reputation high, and keep your employees longer."***

Another example from Daniel:

> I start off by asking people why they joined. They typically answer like this:

- Ads: they didn't work, and they wasted $30k on it
- They bought coaching products that didn't work
- They already tried cold email and couldn't get it to work
- Scared of relying on outside agencies to keep their business alive
- Scared of having to go back to a 9-5 job
- Scared of needing to raise VC money to have a successful business

CA Offer: ***"B2B Companies, Marketing Agencies, Consultants, and Freelancers: We show you how to get clients with cold email without wasting thousands of dollars on ads or relying on outside agencies to keep your business alive"***

People care about **Speed** and **Certainty**.

## Make Money Online

!!! tip

    This is Video #10 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How To ACTUALLY Make Money Online - No BS Guide (Everything Else Is Garbage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deAzlMzvhRU) - 8 November 2022

Opening with a banger quote:

> Nothing happens for so long and everything happens at once.

### How this Works

In order to acquire money you need to have somebody give it to you.

So you need to offer somebody something that they value more the $x amount of money.

There’s 3 things you can sell:

1. Make more money: Increase sales - Decrease time spent
2. Become healthier
3. Have more s*x

We'll talk about the **first one**.

Because that allows us to enter a different realm than what you’re thinking: BUSINESS TO BUSINESS (B2B).

It means you’re a business selling a service to another business - of which it is either going to **make them more sales** or **decrease the amount of time** they’re spending in their business.

It’s also going to be a service business - which means you will be exchanging your time as opposed to a physical product which requires capital.

No capital, no logistics.

#### 2 Types of B2B

There are two types of B2B Service Businesses you should run.

You should only do one of these two:

**Productized Service** - you do the same thing every time for every person, performative results not dependent on you.

**Performative Based Agency** - highly complex done-for-you service where your results are tied to performance (You get paid a lot doing this).

You need to pay very close attention to this whole spiel I’m about to go through because it’s very important: 

***"Beginners should start with productized services because of low complexity and lack of competence necessary"***

Experts should charge a lot of money because they’ve proven themselves capable of delivering abnormal results.

You cannot become the person capable of delivering abnormal results without reps - and a productized service business will allow you to execute those reps and become capable of delivering abnormal results.

So the sequence is - "Productized Service to Performative Based Agency".

### Examples

See the examples.

#### Examples of Productized Service

- Tik Tok style video captioning (go look on the Shorts on my YouTube channel on Daniel's page)

- Making ad creatives for people (static images or videos)

    - You’re not running the ads, you’re just making the creatives. Actual ad itself.

- Ghostwriting social media posts

    - LinkedIn posts

    - Twitter threads

- Design agency

    - Unlimited design packages where you allow people to make submissions

- YouTube video editing

    - Daniel pays an editor to do all of the little animations and cutting and thumbnail designs for these videos.

    - Two types of people to prospect:

        - Those already running a channel (meaning your lead pool is people who presently have YouTube videos - look for people in the business niche who have unedited videos. Then find their other social media channels like **Twitter** and IG and message them. If they don’t respond, keep messaging. ***Keep messaging until you get a firm yes or no***)

        - Those not currently running a channel (meaning your lead pool is people in the business niche on **LinkedIn** or **Twitter** and your angle is CONVINCING them to use YouTube i.e.
        
            - ***“I can make it extremely easy for you to post videos I just need raw footage of screenshares with your face on it and I’ll take care of everything else"***)

- Influencer Marketing

    - You facilitate the purchasing of influencer posts by Tik Tok influencers and ecommerce brands. 
    
        - UGC ads. Charge roughly 2x-3x what the influencer would otherwise post.

        - You are literally a broker. Facilitate a transaction.

#### Examples of Performative Based Agencies

At this point you've been running your productized service business for about 9-12 months and all of the growth of such business is completely back-loaded towards the end.

So you are now hitting a breaking point of becoming extremely competent in the **peripheral things** you did not know existed before.

***Example***:

You did influencer marketing (you were facilitating the purchase of UGC influencer posts on TikTok for ecommerce brands)

You've done 500 of these at this point and you've acquired a couple things:

1. You've noticed trends about how to make the ads work very well - a specific sequence & formula to increase the probability of them popping up.

2. You've acquired a bank of 300+ creators who regularly will make posts for you (you've developed a relationship with them - you now have **an asset**).

3. Your clients wanted to experiment with TikTok ads so you started spending ad money for them on the TikTok ads manager in addition to the influencer posts.

!!! tip

    You **NOW** have the capability, expertise and assets necessary to offer a performative based agency offer where you work with large brands for a lot of money, and that might look like the following:

    Price: $10,000/mo + %10 of revenue generated on TikTok

    Deliverables: 60 posts per month, minimum ad spend $50,000/mo

You make a business $1,000,000 per month on TikTok congratulations you are making $110,000/mo.

!!! warning

    You CANNOT offer this service until you know how to do it.

    Understand.

    You CANNOT start AT THIS PLACE.

    Such is the nature of why you start with a productized service business to develop the **capability**, **assets** and **expertise** in the first place.

### Timeline

Now, here is your timeline:

**Day 0-30 Research**:

- Watch all of the YouTube videos Daniel presently have available on my channel.
- Pick a productized Service.
- Look up videos on that particular service and watch 30 hours.
- Go buy some courses on Udemy.
- Practice doing it for free, unprompted to the target market.

**Day 30-35 Your Place on Internet**:

- Make a landing page on cardd.co (19 dollar per year)
- Film a video of yourself on Loom & a google Doc explaining what your service is and why it can help them
- Embed a calendy link below it (booking calls)

**Day 35-95 Outreach**:

- Take your unprompted work and give it to the people who you did it for
- Find their emails and cold email them.
- Follow [Twitter Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdn-lLZ-og) video to an absolute T (do exactly what Daniel says).
- Your marketing strategy is doing work **completely unprompted** and giving it to the person.

But that doesn't scale. (LOL).

Why are you worrying about scale when you are at $0?

Repeat:

> Why are you worrying about scale when you are at $0?

At $0 only thing you have is Time.

You have to start with payment of time.

### Examples of Execution

**Productized Service Biz 1**: TikTok style video captioning (Shorts Video Production)

- Daniel purchased this because somebody who follows him on Twitter found a podcast he was on that was posted on Youtube.
- He then sent a video of that he edited of Daniel in DM's and told Daniel he could post it.
- Daniel did, got a ton of engagement
- He then sent two more, and asked I Daniel wanted to be his client
- Daniel said yes

**Productized Service Biz 2**: Making Ad Creatives for Brands

- Target is Ecommerce Brands or Software Companies.
- Saw a guy run this up to $30k/mo in 30 days (he used to run different businesses so there was competence) by doing the following:
- Made a giant thread of "30 days of ads" where he would post static image ad design for brands, then tag the founders and the brands. It was done in the same thread.
- Made TikTok videos of him actively designing ads inside Figma (this was smart).

**Productized Service Biz 3**: Ghost Writing Social Media Posts

- All the guys Daniel seen successfully do this have done it through inbound leads (this means the leads come to you)
- If you are going to get ghostwriting clients to help people grow on Twitter (or LinkedIn) - you need a lot of followers.
- [Dakota Robertson](https://www.dakotarobertson.net/) is an example of this.
- He has been doing it so long he basically designed a system to always be viral (and he is the Twitter coach in Client Ascension)
- Again, follow the Twitter Masterclass of Daniel.

**Productized Service Biz 4**: Design Agency

- Daniels brother does this
- Makes nice visuals on Twitter and Instagram
- People come to him organically and have him design posts for their profiles
- Follow the Twitter Masterclass.

**Productized Service Biz 5**: Youtube Video Editing

- Daniel found his editor because he tweeted that he was going to start on Youtube

- He got a message from the guy telling him he's an editor and he sent links to his work

- If you don't already have work done, follow this:

    1. Find people in business niche with unedited videos who ALREADY have videos on Youtube. Find them on Twitter, Instagram or email.

    2. Send them a message like "Hey {name}, Just watched your video on Youtube about X and loved what you said about y. Wanted to send over a message because I think your channel could pop off with proper editing, keyword research and thumbnails. Are you going to make more videos soon? (I'd be happy to edit your first for free)" (If they do not respond, follow up. Follow up until you get a yes or no)

    3. When they post the edited video you make, come back to them after a couple days with bunch of more video ideas you source from [VidIQ](https://vidiq.com/) (keyword research)

This is currently around $400 - $800 per video.

**Productized Service Biz 6**: Influencer Marketing

- Target is ecom brands

- Service is getting them ads made by TikTok influencers

- Cold email a bunch of ecommerce brands (you can get their emails from something like contactecom.com or storeleads.com) 

- Email script like ***"Hey {name}, quick question, are you guys looking for UGC ads from TikTok influencers? I can get 10-20 videos made for {{x product}}"***

- Charge brands anywhere between $100-$400 per video.

- Find UGC influencer on Twitter by going into Twitter Search Bar and simply typing "UGC" - there is a big community there.

### Action Items

- Consume information with care.

## ROI Calculator

!!! tip

    This is Video #22 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[The ROI Calculator: Sign More Clients Using Pure Logic (B2B, SMMA, & Marketing Agencies)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FepWs1qV3xg) - 29 December 2022

A couple months ago, you took initiative to start a business.

You did some market research, built a landing page, started sending cold emails or cold calls, and began booking meetings.

But you're hitting a roadblock: you're getting on sales calls and struggling to convert prospects into paying clients.

Let’s solve that today using the **ROI Calculator** and pure logic — a tactic most are not using.

### You Are a B2B Service Company

Your business likely falls into the category of a **B2B service company** — and its entire purpose is to deliver ROI for your clients.

Clients aren’t buying your service just to spend money — they want **profit**.

Let’s walk through two examples to understand how to pitch with ROI in mind.

### Example 1: E-commerce Email Marketing Agency

You charge: **$3,000/month**

#### Prospect 1:

* **Email list size:** 30,000
* **Product profit margin:** 40%
* **Estimated increase in monthly sales due to email marketing:** $32,000
* **Profit from those sales:** $12,800 (40% of $32,000)
* **ROI:** $12,800 / $3,000 = **4.3x**

> This is a logical and profitable investment.

#### Prospect 2:

* **Email list size:** 5,000
* **Profit margin:** 30%
* **Estimated sales increase:** $5,500
* **Profit from sales:** $1,650
* **ROI:** $1,650 / $3,000 = **Loss**

> Doesn’t make financial sense for them. They lose money.

**Only two options:**

1. Lower your price (not recommended)
2. **Only pitch to larger businesses** (recommended)

### Example 2: Lead Generation Agency

You charge: **$400 per booked call**

#### Prospect 1:

* **Service price:** $300/month
* **LTV (avg 6-month retention):** $1,800
* **Close rate:** 20%
* **5 booked calls → 1 sale**
* **Total cost (5 calls):** $2,000
* **ROI:** Negative ($1,800 LTV < $2,000 cost)

#### Prospect 2:

* **Service price:** $8,000/month
* **LTV (6 months):** $48,000
* **Close rate:** 20%
* **5 calls → 1 sale**
* **Cost (5 calls):** $2,000
* **ROI:** $46,000 profit

> Same pricing. Different result. Why? The **prospect’s economics**.

### What This Means for You

Stop lowering prices. **Start selling to businesses with more upside.**

If you’re not closing calls, you’re probably pitching to the wrong people — people for whom your offer logically doesn’t make sense.

Instead:

* **Screen share** a Google Doc
* Walk through **conservative ROI calculations** with them
* If the numbers work, **offer a guarantee**

You will close more.

### Consultative Sales Approach (Use This Script)

> "Thanks for getting on the call. You’re running a business, which likely means your goal is profit. If it’s okay, I’d like to ask a few questions to determine if this is financially viable for both of us. If I feel confident, I’ll give you an offer and possibly even a guarantee."

Then ask:

* What kind of business do you run (B2B or B2C)?
* Who are you targeting?
* Is your market reachable through cold email?
* How much do you charge?
* How many clients would you need to break even with our service?

Now you’re having a **financial conversation**, not a **sales pitch**.

### Scale?

If you want to:

* Charge more
* Get more clients
* Close more calls

Table of contents as follows:

### Offers

#### Market Demand

Making an Irresistible Offer That Sells to **Cold Traffic**.

You have to make an offer that sells to cold traffic. Not warm.

!!! tip

    Did you get that part?
    
    Cold Traffic do not buy:

    - Measurement implementation for e-commerce brands

    they are buying:

    - Implementation of a webinar funnel so that they could make money. Not data analytics.

#### Concrete Results

!!! example

    "We'll build you a quiz funnel for your cold traffic ads that will double your qualified leads."

    is a specific and result-focused offer.

    "We provide comprehensive digital marketing services"

    is NOT.

Daniel restructured an offer to:

!!! example

    "13 quote ready remodeling projects booked into your calender in the next 90 days using AI-powered SEO and free ad management"

    Notice the specificity - 13 projects, 90 days, using specific tech.

#### Clear Value Proposition

Trying to make a complex service that bundles 5-10 different services together can be overwhelming for the client.

!!! example

    One guy was trying to sell tech management, growth marketing, lead intake all bundled together.

    Cold email will never respond to - "Do you need someone to manage your technology?"

    Instead of that, identify one offer that will get people to raise their hand and book a call.

    For most cold traffic that would be:

    - AI-focused offers. (they are novel)

    - Growth marketing with quantifiable claim

    - Something with a unique guarantee

The rest of the services can be sold **AFTER** - NOT BEFORE - **AFTER** you've required the customer.

!!! tip

    This is what Daniel does in ListKit. People come in for cold email and they are cross sold to other services.

!!! note "banger"

    People have different things as what they want and need.

    They might actually **need** tech management and lead intake etc.

    What they want, is more customers.

    So what they need does not matter in this perspective.

    Banger incoming:

    ***Once you sell them what they want, you can sell them what they need later.***


You get cold traffic in the door with a cold traffic offer - and then LATER ON sell them what they actually need.

!!! tip

    Everyone NEEDS to go to the gym and eat healthy food, but they want Ozempic.

    There is a reason broccoli farmers aren't billionaires and makers of Ozempic are.

#### Appropriate Pricing

If you do not have a ton of case studies yet, you cannot charge premium prices to cold traffic.

It won't convert. You need to match your pricing to your perceived authority in the market.

!!! tip

    Here is a banger.

    A student in CA who was trying to sell a $10k package with a 90-day guarantee but only had 7% close rate.

    A 7% close rate is a massive indicator that you are overpriced.
    
    Your pricing should be at a level that you exactly close between 18-30% of your calls.

    If it's any lower, you are charging too much money in relation to your level of authority.

You need to be realistic about what your level of authority is.

Daniel advised this student to lower his price temporarily until he builds more case studies.

This is not forever. It's a strategic move to get more clients in the door, build case studies then raise your prices as your authority increases.

#### Guarantee Structure

With less authority, you need a stronger guarantee.

If you are just starting out, you might have to start with a performance based model or a strong money back guarantee.

As authority increases you can shift to less risky structures for you.

!!! tip

    Remember, guarantee is there to compensate for lack of case studies.

    If you have 50 amazing testimonials, you don't need as strong of a guarantee.

- Less Authority: Stronger Guarantee Required

- More Authority: Less Requirement for a Guarantee

#### New Opportunities

It's tough to sell "I can do your current marketing better than you can."

They have to admit that they are doing poorly, and you have to be dramatically better to justify the cost.

This typically also results in situations where you are trying to pitch people who actively believe they're better than you.

For instance, Daniel gets ton of people pitching me to write emails to his list or come up with his YouTube content.

99% of the time this comes from somebody who doesn't even have their own their YouTube channel and their own email list.

!!! warning

    In this case, all the evidence points to Daniel being better than them.
    
    And paying them money to do if for Daniel would actively result in Daniel getting worse results.

Instead, focus on solving new problems or making new opportunities.

"I will build a quiz funnel for cold traffic is making a new revenue stream, not replacing an existing one. Much easier to sell."

***You ideally want to make something new for them!***

!!! example

    You sell YouTube Management or Content Marketing.

    ❌ Bad Offer: Targeting People Who Already Do Well on Youtube

    ✅ Better Offer: Targeting People Who Already Do Well on Another Platform but DO NOT use Youtube

It's always easier to get somebody to Start something new as opposed to selling them something that IMPROVES something they already do.

!!! tip

    All of this content in Offers is a **Requirement** for anything else in the rest of the course.


#### The Summary For Offers**:

- **Market Demand** - Offer is something the market already wants to buy.
- **Concrete Results** - Offer delivers concrete, specific results.
- **Clear Value Proposition** - Offer focuses on one clear value proposition for front-end acquisition.
- **Appropriate Pricing** - Offer is priced appropriately for your authority level.
- **Guarantee Structure** - Offer has the right guarantee structure in relation to your authority level.
- **New Opportunities** - Offer makes new opportunities rather than replacing existing functions.

If you get this right, you have laid the foundations to scale.

### Marketing Channels

Once you have an offer that converts the next question is: 

"How do you get it in front of the right people?"

The answer changes depending on where you are in your growth journey.

Here are the stages:

#### Stage 1

This is where you are at $0-$10k per month.

Your primary goal is to get your first 5-10 client and build case studies.

You have a limited time and no marketing budget.

!!! tip

    Let's make this clear.

    FIRST: Get Case Studies

    SECOND: Make Money

    If you try to put making money BEFORE getting case studies, you end up with less money.


Here is what works best:

- **Manual Outreach** - Dream 100 strategics where you're identifying perfect-fit prospects and doing personalized outreach.

- **Cold Email** - Despite what you might hear, cold email works, and when done right, with the right offer to the right target audience.

All deliverability & spam problems are a result of people actively marking you as spam.

If you have a good offer and send it to a relevant audience, they simply do not mark you as spam and therefore your results are therefore better.

This fundamentally does not work without a good offer.

- **Linkedin**

Both content and direct outreach can work here, but make sure you are posting consistently (5x per week) and doing targeted outreach to people who engage.

Keep them simple:

!!! example

    Hey {{name}}, are you interested in AI Cold Callers?

#### Stage 2

I am not here yet. 

So:

TODO

#### Stage 3

Not here yet.

TODO.


### Leveraging AI

TODO

#### First

- Making Content and Repurposing:

You can literally find content ideas with the prompt:

"I'm working with a client runs X business and wants to start Youtube Content. Generate 20 video ideas targeting high-intent keywords their audience would be searching for."

- Extract Core Lessons from Existing Content

Upload transcripts of sales calls, consulting calls, client or networking calls.

Ask it to extract the core lessons and principles from the conversations. Then direct it to format these lessons & principles into content for Linkedin or Twitter or Email list.

- Youtube Video Repurposing

Input a Youtube video link to get the transcript.

Upload to LLM. Give it a prompt like this:

"You've been given a transcript from one of my recent Youtube videos. I want you to make 10 tweets based on these lessons from this Youtube Video. The tweets should be written to independently perform well."

#### Second

Sales Script and Email Generation.

You can literally take top performing content with a transcriber,

### Building Systems

### Building Market Authority

### Action Steps

If you are at $0-$10k a month:

- Make a winning offer: Focus on making one front-end offer that actually sells to cold traffic.

- Manual Outreach - Implement manual outreach through Dream 100 and cold email

- Content Creation - Start making content that establishes your expertise

- Build Case Studies - Focus on getting 5-10 solid case studies.

## The Beginner Business

!!! tip

    This is Video #5 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[The #1 Online Business To Start As A Beginner NOW (before it's too late)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAUnfCv2N3U) - 8 September 2022

Let’s be honest—there’s no business on Earth that requires *no time*. You will have to put in effort. But this path can be *easier*.

### Product Business vs. Service Business

Let’s understand the difference between a **product business** and a **service business**:

#### Product Business

* Think: eCommerce store
* You need inventory (capital upfront)
* You need ad spend for traffic
* **Low capital efficiency, low margin**

**Example:**

* Sale: \$100
* Cost of product: -\$30
* Cost of ads: -\$30
* **Profit: \$40**

#### Service Business

* Think: Social media marketing agency
* Requires **time** instead of **capital** for fulfillment
* Still requires outreach—but you can replace ad spend with *outbound marketing* (DMs, cold emails, cold calls)

So, if you don’t have a lot of money but *do* have time → **start a service business**.

### Market Sophistication Levels

As more people offer a particular service, it gets harder to get clients. Here’s how market sophistication levels work:

**Level 1**: Nobody is doing it, everybody wants it
**Level 2**: Claims have to be higher, more proof needed
**Level 3**: Courses emerge, exaggerated claims, offshoots form
**Level 4**: Cold war—faster, cheaper, more
**Level 5**: Storytelling—people buy from *you*, not just the service

So we want a service business that’s currently at **Market Sophistication Level 1**.

### The Best Service to Sell in 2023

**Short-form content making for businesses**

Why?

* It’s a service business (requires time, not much capital)
* It’s currently at level 1 (easy to sell, many businesses want it)
* You can do outbound outreach (DMs, cold emails)

Businesses you can target:

* Course creators
* Coaches
* Software founders
* Agencies
* Even local businesses (e.g., TikTok for restaurants in Singapore)

---

### What You'll Need

1. **Learn video editing**

   * Use YouTube tutorials (Premiere Pro, CapCut, etc.)
   * Study viral videos.
   * Take notes. Deconstruct hooks, pacing, and design.

2. **Practice the craft**

   * Make your own content
   * Offer free editing to a few businesses for experience

3. **Build assets**

   * Landing page with explainer video
   * Twitter & LinkedIn profile

4. **Outreach**

   * Direct message business owners daily
   * Cold email if you're comfortable

5. **Improve your craft as you go**

   * Learn copywriting
   * Understand email follow-ups
   * Study landing page optimization

People who'll buy short form content:

- Courses
- Software COmpanies
- Coaching
- Agencies

This is a really good business to start right now. You have 8–10 months before short-form content starts reaching levels 2 and 3 in market saturation.

🎥 I’ll link a full video guide to marketing on Twitter next—combine it with this offer, and you’ll be dangerous.

That’s it for today. Farewell, my friends!

## Stick with a Business Model

!!! tip

    This is Video #16 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Stick with ONE Business Model For A LONG Time - You'll Make More Money Online (Here's Why)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNtEXQ7B3RU) - 5 December 2022

### The Journey from Info Products to High Ticket

**[Andre](https://x.com/andrehaykaljr):** But yeah man, yeah it's been a crazy journey since we first met up in Tampa like a year ago. And so one of the questions I think would be good for the audience to hear more about is:

> How do you transition from selling info products to going into high ticket, and how do you view both of those different business models if someone is just getting started?

**Daniel**: You never want to sit there and just sell a course for too long, because people are going to sit here and then you're going to be labeled as just the guy who sells courses—and that's the entirety of your business.

And such would have also been the nature for me had I not made software companies, right?

So it's like—you had to do a bunch of different things with cold email, use a bunch of different software, so I sat here and just replicated every single software app.

And then that was when I was kind of *not* labeled as just a course seller.

So it's like—you do want to expand, and you can do that with a high ticket offer as well.

### When to Create a Coaching Offer

But in general, if you're sitting here—if you do have a course or if you have an agency and you've accomplished some specific task using some specific mechanism—you can translate that into a coaching program because you have accomplished something.

And the offer looks pretty simple:

> "We're going to show you how to do this using this."

And that’s it.

You just sell in a different format—**fulfillment format**—for what you’ve already been doing.

So it's like, if you're sitting here and you're really good at Facebook ads, and you've scaled a bunch of companies (either in an agency or you own the company with Facebook ads), you can pretty easily make:

> "Hey, we're going to show you how to scale your company with Facebook ads."

Looks pretty simple.

### Don’t Jump Into Selling Courses Too Early

**[Christian](https://x.com/cbwritescopy):** Talk about that real quick—because I feel like a lot of people jump from starting out to selling a course without getting enough experience in between to be qualified to sell a course or run a coaching program.

So talk about getting experience with the skill before you try to monetize it with info products.

Yeah—well, what's going to happen is:

Say you start an agency and maybe you get the agency to like 5K–10K a month.

And yeah, I mean it’s ethical to sit here and say:

> "I’m going to make a coaching program or course to show you how to make 5K or 10K a month in the agency."

Yeah—you can do that.

But—**if you don't take something to 50K or 100K**, then you can't ever morph into teaching people how to do that.

### Mastery Through Scale: Avoiding the Hop

I was talking with David Mendes about this yesterday. He's doing a really good job with his agency right now—his high ticket coaching programs—and he's working with Brooke.

And I told him:

> "Yo, stick with Brooke and try to just get this thing to 500K a month or a mil a month. And it might take you a year or two years—but at the end of it, you're gonna be the person capable of creating a 500K/month business or a $1M/year business."

This is why you **don’t want to hop** too much.

Because you go through ceilings—where you have to fundamentally change:

* how you operate
* what you know
* and how you execute

to break past the ceiling.

And if you just **churn and burn business models**, you’ll always get it up to that one ceiling—and never break past it.

### Become the Person Who Can Do It

So you need to stick with one particular thing for a long time—so you can go past a large array of ceilings.

And then, if you take one business to a million a month, you can take **basically any business** (obviously it has to be a good offer) to a million a month.

Like, look at **Alex Hormozi**.

He literally sits here and just acquires info product businesses—because he took an info product business to like 50M/year.

So he's pretty confident in his ability to take any other info product business and also get it to 50M/year.

And **that’s what you have to do**. You really gotta stick with something for a long time—so you just **become the person** capable of doing that.

### The Real Goal: Actually Being Good

And *that* is the whole point, right?

To actually be good.

And that takes a really long time.

## Beginners Struggle

!!! tip

    This is Video #18 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Why Beginners Struggle in Business & Can't Make More Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckDu3P6T-ZI) - 9 December 2022

### The Business Opportunity Trap

Typically, what happens when somebody gets started in business is they'll buy a business opportunity course.

A **business opportunity course** is a course that tells you what specific thing to sell to what specific kind of person.

If 3,000 people buy that course and the target audience is 300,000 people, and only about 1% of that audience is ready to purchase right now, then your potential customer pool becomes incredibly limited.

The sheer amount of competition makes your allotment (the process of sharing something, or the amount that you get) of opportunity small.

You can imagine what happens as more people start selling the same business opportunity: **saturation**.

It’s not that the opportunity is impossible, but it changes the game—you now have to **change your selling technique**.

If 10,000 people are selling cold email services to marketing agencies or B2B businesses, and they're all using cold email to do it, then you're not just selling the same thing to the same target audience—you’re using the same marketing channel too.

You can’t compete unless you do what others won’t and establish staying power.

### The Advantage of Staying Power

X amount of people are going to give up and churn.

But if you stick with it, keep generating client results, make videos on it, appear on podcasts, and learn beyond what the course told you.

You will surpass the people who created the business opportunity in the first place.

Eventually, you become the go-to expert.

It’s not about hating business opportunity courses—if you bought one, that’s fine.

But there’s a delusion that buying a course will instantly get you to $10K a month.

You’re not going to make $10K in your first month of business.

You don’t even know how to operate a business yet.

### From X to Z (and Beyond)

You need **staying power**.

You stick with it long enough that X leads to Y, then to Z, then to W.

And over the course of a year, you accumulate knowledge. You become powerful.

You become someone who knows what they’re doing.

That’s how people get to $100K or $200K months. Not overnight.

Many have been in business for four years or more.

And sure, you might get angry at their success.

But as Alex Hormozi says: maybe you should get angry at yourself for not being better.

Because the truth is—they're just better than you.

And the only way to change that is to become better yourself.

That’s what most people don’t want to hear.

But it’s the truth.

## Asymmetric Opportunities

!!! tip

    This is Video #24 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Creating Offers That Sell: Selling Asymmetric Opportunities To Get More Clients (B2B Companies)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JcS3TzRNnM) - 4 January 2023

Here’s your formatted transcript in a clean and structured format:

---

### How to Sell Asymmetric Offers That Actually Work

If you're trying to sell something, you're going to make a claim like:

> "I'm going to sell you this. You're going to give me money, but in return, I'm going to give you something *more valuable* than what you paid."

This is called selling **asymmetric opportunities**—and it's the foundation of a functional business.

> You say: "I'm really good at this. I’ll execute it for you in exchange for this amount of money. But my execution, applied to what you already have, is going to make you *way more* than what you paid me."

**That’s literally how business works.**

### The Client Ascension Model

Client Ascension operates exactly like this:

* We make a clear claim:

  > “You're going to make **way more** than you invest with us.”

* It works. Go to [clientascension.com](https://clientascension.com), opt in, and you’ll see:

  * Screenshots
  * Case studies
  * Proof of people making a lot of money

Here’s how it works in practice:

* A B2B company joins (marketing agency, consultant, freelancer, etc.)

* We help them spin up **outbound campaigns**:

  * Cold emails
  * Pre-written scripts
  * Lead lists
  * Software setup

* We do this **faster** than anyone else.

It works—*fast*.

### You Must Deliver More Than They Invest

Business is simple:

> Deliver results **greater** than what they paid you.

Some people hesitate to offer guarantees. They say:

> “I want to sign clients, but I don’t want to offer a guarantee. What if I don’t hit the numbers?”

But here’s the truth:

* You charge $5,000.
* You run ads. The client spends \$10,000.
* They only make $2,000 in return.

They **lost money**. You **didn’t** deserve the $5,000.

That’s *not* an asymmetric offer. That’s theft.

### Why We Screen Who We Work With

At Client Ascension, we only work with people who have—or can develop—a functional offer.

> We don’t try to hard sell people who won’t succeed. That’s not our model.

What happens on our sales calls:

* We *diagnose* your current offer.
* We tell you honestly:

  * ✅ “Yes, this works.”
  * ❌ “No, this won’t work. Here’s what you need to change.”

If you’re not ready, we’ll give you next steps to fix it before you join.

Because if we don’t think it will work—we don’t want you inside.

## There is no Saturation

!!! tip

    This is Video #32 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[There Is No Business Model That’s TOO Saturated.. Let Me Explain (You can get clients for anything)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71TSnjKP98w) - 28 March 2023

[The document](https://gamma.app/docs/When-to-know-if-a-business-is-saturated-arorkj2jnlvru7q?mode=doc) linked in the video.

### Saturation Does Not Exist

Saturation doesn't actually exist the way you think.

What gets saturated is copying a **marketing channel**, **offer structure**, or **pitch scripts** — not the service itself.

You need to understand how to protect yourself from this false sense of saturation and focus on results-based positioning.

### The Real Problem: Market Sophistication

When markets evolve, they get exposed to more claims and angles.

That doesn’t mean a service becomes saturated.

It means the **buyer becomes more sophisticated**.

Relying on "Facebook ads" or "short-form content" as your pitch doesn’t work because you’re marketing the mechanism, not the result.

> **Wrong:** I’ll edit your short-form content.
>
> **Right:** I’ll get you 3–10 new clients per month passively using my organic content operation system.

What you're selling is the **gap** between a current state and a desired state — not the mechanism.

### Sell the Gap, Not the Service

Buyers only care about what they get. You're not selling Google Ads — you're selling more sales.

You're not selling email marketing — you're selling more clients.

Use the formula:

* Current State ➝ End State
* Your system/solution is the **bridge**

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Business](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/what_is_business.png)
  <figcaption>Basically Business</figcaption>
</figure>

This becomes critical as markets mature.

### At The End of the Sophistication Cycle

Sophisticated buyers only purchase based on:

1. **Results**
2. **Proof**
3. **You being the person to deliver it**

So instead of staying surface-level, **go straight to the end of the cycle**:

> I get results. Here’s proof. Here’s how I do it.

### Four Ways to Shield Yourself from Saturation

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Separation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/when_market_gets_saturated.png)
  <figcaption>This is how you separate</figcaption>
</figure>

#### 1. **Claims**

* Promise specific end states.
* Position yourself as the gateway to those outcomes.

> This organic content marketing system will help you sign 3-10 clients per month.

You see the gap right?

#### 2. **Proof**

* Show you’ve done it before.
* Sophisticated buyers don’t want refunds — they want results.

They want it to work.

#### 3. **Competency**

* Use social content to show you deeply understand micro-nuance.
* Guides, tutorials, walkthroughs build trust.

They want to see that you understand micro-nuance.

They want to sit and watch you display you know these micro intricacies of making things work particularly well.

Free stuff is for displaying competency.

#### 4. **Consistency**

* Stay in front of your audience over time.
* **Conversion windows** vary — not everyone buys today.

Do this for months, for years.

### You Need Time

Your timeline is off. You measure in days and weeks.

But the only valid unit of progress is **quarters**.

You must stay in one business for at least **6–12 months** before expecting big traction.

> If you keep switching at 5K/month, you will always be the kind of person who can only hit 5K/month.

You can't stack multiple 5K businesses into a real company.

You need one that hits 50K.

### Final Words

Stop switching models. 

Stop blaming saturation. 

Stick with one business. 

Refine your offer. 

Show proof. 

Build a system around it.
