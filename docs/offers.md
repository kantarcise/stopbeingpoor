## Offers from the Glossary

From this [banger tweet](https://x.com/blackhatwizardd/status/1849157663398965449).

An **offer** is a set of deliverables that help a client reach a specific quantifiable goal.

"Sign 10 clients in the next month with cold email" is an offer.

"Increase your revenue by a minimum of $25k/mo with our email flows" is an offer.

It's an "offer" when the facilitation of it can lead to an end goal.

You need to do one clear thing, for one clear person, with one clear outcome and one clear risk reversal with one clear evidence that you are able to do that.

What you do, who you serve, what the terms are?
