# Offers

## Definition

From this [banger tweet](https://x.com/blackhatwizardd/status/1849157663398965449).

An **offer** is a set of deliverables that help a client reach a specific quantifiable goal.

"Sign 10 clients in the next month with cold email" is an offer.

"Increase your revenue by a minimum of $25k/mo with our email flows" is an offer.

It's an "offer" when the facilitation of it can lead to an end goal.

You need to do one clear thing, for one clear person, with one clear outcome and one clear risk reversal with one clear evidence that you are able to do that.

What you do, who you serve, what the terms are?

## Offer Formulation

[Offer Formulation: Getting Clients & Signing More Deals for SMMA, Marketing Agency, B2B companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opE6MRW9Ceg) - 2 Jan 2023 - I wrote all these notes while listening but the [doc is here too](https://gamma.app/docs/How-to-Create-an-Offer-that-Clients-Buy-Examples-Formulation-ldh3tzo3ui98hr7?mode=doc).

- **Specific Problem**

- **Unique Mechanism**

- **Pricing / Terms**

- **Risk Reversal**

!!! tip

    Solve a problem **big enough**. That's the most important part here. See [offer positioning](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#offer-positioning)

### Specific Problem

You can get away with not solving a specific problem and a unique mechanism like this:

- "I'll front the cost of your facebook advertising. I'll write the copy, make the ads and use my own ad account. You give me 20% of the deals that close"

This will NOT work:

- "I charge $3000 to manage your Facebook ads"

Instead, let's just find the specific problem. 😎

Examples:

- [Hyros](https://hyros.com/) - Ad attribution with pixels is horrible and doesn't work. Fixes this with %98 accuracy. (Current headline: *"Track more sales. Feed to AI. Scale further. HYROS is a patented AI attribution & AI system that on average increases ad scale by 20% across over 3000+ clients*)

- [Cole Gordon](https://closers.io/): You're not getting enough calls from your opt ins. Places appointment setter in your business to call the leads. (Current headline: *We help businesses find proven salespeople, ramp them into KPI, and systematize management so they can work on their business, not in it.*)

So,  how to find specific problems?

**Answer**: ***Source it from the niche you have in your head (in an actually human way)***

Let's say the niche you've chosen is SaaS companies who just raised some money.

In Email - Twitter - Linkedin - Instagram:

> Hey {{name}}, I'm thinking about starting up an agency or a service company of some sort, and thought of SaaS companies as a niche.

> What problems do you guys actually have? I don't want to sit here and make something up, I want to solve a real problem.

You are talking to a human.

The more individualization the more response rates.

### Unique Mechanism

You need to turn the "thing" you are selling into a system.

This is your "special way" you do something. If you frame your "special way" as ACTUALLY special, and display you are capable of delivering abnormally good results, you can charge more money.

**Example**: An email copywriter:

**Question**: "What makes you good at at email marketing?" 

**His Answer**:

- Coaching/Info product owners make a huge mistake with their email list.

- All they do is pitch pitch pitch "book a call book a call book a call "

- Nobody shows any personality. Any cold traffic that comes in will immediately unsubscribe from email list. You burn the lead forever.

- You need to play the long game. Not everybody knows who you are and you have to show them your personality on the email list.

- But most people don't know how to write copy correctly, let alone have the time to sit down and write it.

- I get on interviews with my clients. Almost like a therapist, I ask them questions and dig deep. I hypnotize myself into becoming them. And I write emails that show their personality and are completely indistinguishable from them actually writing.

You see: "High Income Skill" -> "Unique System"

**Example**: Client Ascension Provides the service for people to turn their offer into a unique system.

The Ascension Scaling System.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![The Client Ascension Way](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/ca_pipeline.png)
  <figcaption>The Client Ascension Way</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! warning 

    This might be updated now.

- People think they need to spend a lot of money or get investment money to have a successful business. They think there is no way you can hit $50000 without the help of VC's or access to industry secrets.

- We make it easy for them by:

    - Writing cold email scripts

    - Giving them the software for free

    - Giving them 3000 leads to send their cold emails to

    - Giving them Tweet templates & engagement

    - Twitter message scripts

    - Linkedin message scripts

    - Turning their offer to high ticket offer

    - Guaranteeing they add an Minimum $10k/mo in MRR or they don't pay.

That's a strong offer if I ever seen one.

### Pricing / Terms

How much you charge.

**Performative Offer**:

- Achieve specific quantifiable results
- Ad agencies

**Productized Service**:

- Based solely on deliverables
- Quantifiable results not dependent on you

For detailed explanation on this, see [Make Money Online](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#make-money-online).


You want **sophisticated buyers**. The more you charge the easier it is.

!!! tip

    If you are talking to a large company it's strange to not charge large amount of money.

    The association is that you do not know what you are doing.

    Specific problem and the unique mechanism. The pricing becomes semi inconsequential.

If you are a beginner, you have no idea what to charge.

You are going to have a hard time operating a sales call. (see video [ROI Calculator](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#roi-calculator))

You should almost always charge a performance basis.

This is not just for the clients it's **also for you**.

**High Ticket vs Low Ticket**

This might seem astronomically far away, but it's not.

Even if you are doing the thing, there is still an amount of effort that must be exerted to get the client the deliverable.

Here is an example 

!!! example

    Here is a pricing mistake.

    **Offer**: 60 short form pieces of content edited and 4 long form Youtube Videos Edited.

    **Price**: $2000

    This wouldn't be so bad if it was just the 60 pieces of short form content. But with the 4 long from Youtube Videos thrown in this becomes an unsustainable disaster. 

    There is no way this guy could ever sign another client at that pricing again.

    It would be logistically impossible to grow this company. The profit margin would be so thin. It would be so much work with so little pay.

Here is how the future might look with this mistake:

!!! warning

    When you do not charge enough money:

    - You don't have free cashflow to invest back into the business (your business is how you actually survive, eat and pay rent)

    - You don't have time to market and get more clients

    - You are miserable working so much, so you don't want to get more clients in the first place.

    - You burn out and your business goes to $0.

    - You think you are a failure but it was really just one mistake. You didn't charge enough money.

Don't let your business fail because you are too afraid to say a higher price on the phone.

Simultaneously, your pricing should be reasonable based on the value you can provide.

**Pricing a Performative Offer**:

- Should be around 5x return on investment (profit) if direct ROI

**Pricing a Productized Service**

Here is the equation:

> Pricing = Relative Perception + Value Add

**Relative Perception**: "You are a video editor. What do video editors normally get paid?"

**Value Add** = "This guy has this incredibly unique system that he uses that sounds really promising. That's definitely worth something."

The **better unique mechanism** you have, the **higher you can charge**. See the [ROI Calculator](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/offers/#roi-calculator).

### Risk Reversal

Risk Reversal is an **amplifier**.

It only comes after you have a specific problem and a unique mechanism. 

Types of risk reversals:

1. You don't pay until it works
2. You pay as it works (performance based agencies)
3. If it doesn't work you don't pay
4. If it doesn't work we'll work with you until it does.

You cannot do 1. Just do 2 or 3 when you get to that stage!

## Offer Positioning

[Offer Positioning: How to Get More Clients for your Agency or B2B Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uai8ZqWMmc)
 - 12 December 2022

Start off by getting these questions answered from your prospects:

1. What did they try, and what didn't work?

2. Did they buy a course?

3. Did they try the thing the thing you're selling and it didn't work?

4. Who's the exact person buying it?

5. What are they scared of?

6. What is going to happen to them if they don't solve this specific problem?

Get it from the people who you are selling to.

Here is a banger example from CA:

Start with: ***"We Train Security Guards to be more aware"***

End with: ***"Security Company Owners: We show you how to keep your insurance rates low, keep your brand reputation high, and keep your employees longer."***

Another example from Daniel:

> I start off by asking people why they joined. They typically answer like this:

- Ads: they didn't work, and they wasted $30k on it
- They bought coaching products that didn't work
- They already tried cold email and couldn't get it to work
- Scared of relying on outside agencies to keep their business alive
- Scared of having to go back to a 9-5 job
- Scared of needing to raise VC money to have a successful business

CA Offer: ***"B2B Companies, Marketing Agencies, Consultants, and Freelancers: We show you how to get clients with cold email without wasting thousands of dollars on ads or relying on outside agencies to keep your business alive"***

People care about **Speed** and **Certainty**.

## Make Money Online

[How To ACTUALLY Make Money Online - No BS Guide (Everything Else Is Garbage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deAzlMzvhRU) - 8 November 2022

In order to acquire money you need to have somebody give it to you.

So you need to offer somebody something that they value more the $x amount of money

### 3 Things to Sell

There’s 3 things you can sell:

1. Make more money: Increase sales - Decrease time spent
2. Become healthier
3. Have more s*x

We'll talk about the first one. Because that allows us to enter a different realm than what you’re thinking: BUSINESS TO BUSINESS (B2B).

It means you’re a business selling a service to another business - of which it is either going to make them more sales or decrease the amount of time they’re spending in their business.

It’s also going to be a service business - which means you will be exchanging your time as opposed to a physical product which requires capital

### 2 Types of B2B

There are two types of B2B Service Businesses You Should Run - You should only do one of these two:

**Productized Service** - you do the same thing every time for every person, performative results not dependent on you

**Performative Based Agency** - highly complex done-for-you service where your results are tied to performance.

You need to pay very close attention to this whole spiel I’m about to go through because it’s very important: ***"Beginners should start with productized services because of low complexity and lack of competence necessary"***

Experts should charge a lot of money because they’ve proven themselves capable of delivering abnormal results

You cannot become the person capable of delivering abnormal results without reps - and a productized service business will allow you to execute those reps and become capable of delivering abnormal results.

#### Examples of Productized Service

- Tik Tok style video captioning (go look on the Shorts on my YouTube channel on Daniel's page)

- Making ad creatives for people (static images or videos)

    - You’re not running the ads, you’re just making the creatives. Actual ad itself.

- Ghostwriting social media posts

    - LinkedIn posts

    - Twitter threads

- Design agency

    - Unlimited design packages where you allow people to make submissions

- YouTube video editing

    - Daniel pays an editor to do all of the little animations and cutting and thumbnail designs for these videos.

    - Two types of people to prospect:

        - Those already running a channel (meaning your lead pool is people who presently have YouTube videos - look for people in the business niche who have unedited videos. Then find their other social media channels like Twitter and IG and message them. If they don’t respond, keep messaging. ***Keep messaging until you get a firm yes or no***)

        - Those not currently running a channel (meaning your lead pool is people in the business niche on LinkedIn or Twitter and your angle is CONVINCING them to use YouTube i.e. “I can make it extremely easy for you to post videos I just need raw footage of screenshares with your face on it and I’ll take care of everything else’)

Influencer Marketing

    - You facilitate the purchasing of influencer posts by Tik Tok influencers and ecommerce brands. UGC ads. Charge roughly 2x-3x what the influencer would otherwise post.

### Examples of Performative Based Agencies

At this point you've been running your productized service business for about 9-12 months and all of the growth of such business is completely back-loaded towards the end.

So you are now hitting a breaking point of becoming extremely competent in the peripheral things you did not know existed before.

***Example***:

You did influencer marketing (you were facilitating the purchase of UGC influencer posts on TikTok for ecommerce brands)

You've done 500 of these at this point and you've acquired a couple things:

1. You've noticed trends about how to make the ads work very well - a specific sequence & formula to increase the probability of them popping up.
2. You've acquired a bank of 300+ creators who regularly will make posts for you (you've developed a relationship with them - you now have an asset).
3. Your clients wanted to experiment with TikTok ads so you started spending ad money for them on the TikTok ads manager in addition to the influencer posts.

!!! tip

    You NOW have the capability, expertise and assets necessary to offer a performative based agency offer where you work with large brands for a lot of money, and that might look like the following:

Price: $10,000/mo + %10 of revenue generated on TikTok

Deliverables: 60 posts per month, minimum ad spend $50,000/mo

You make a business $1,000,000 per month on TikTok congratulations you are making $110,000/mo.

!!! warning

    You CANNOT offer this service until you know how to do it. 

    Such is the nature of why you start with a productized service business to develop the **capability**, **assets** and **expertise** in the first place.

### Timeline

Now, here is your timeline:

**Day 0-30 Research**:

- Watch all of the YouTube videos Daniel presently have available on my channel.
- Pick a productized Service.
- Look up videos on that particular service and watch 30 hours
- Go buy some courses on Udemy
- Practice doing it for free, unprompted to the target market.

**Day 30-35 Your Place on Internet**:

- Make a landing page on cardd.co (19 dollar per year)
- Film a video of yourself on Loom & a google Doc explaining what your service is and why it can help them
- Embed a calendy link below it (booking calls)

**Day 35-95 Outreach**:

- Take your unpromted work and give it to the people who you did it for
- Find their emails and cold email them.
- Follow [Twitter Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdn-lLZ-og) video to an absolute T (do exactly what Daniel says)
- Your marketing strategy is doing work **completely unprompted** and giving it to the person

But that doesn't scale. (LOL).

Why are you worrying about scale when you are at $0?

At $0 only thing you have is Time.

You have to start with payment of time.

### Examples of Execution

**Productized Service Biz 1**: TikTok style video captioning (Shorts Video Production)

- Daniel purchased this because somebody who follows him on Twitter found a podcast he was on that was posted on Youtube.
- He then sent a video of that he edited of Daniel in DM's and told Daniel he could post it.
- Daniel did, got a ton of engagement
- He then sent two more, and asked I Daniel wanted to be his client
- Daniel said yes

**Productized Service Biz 2**: Making Ad Creatives for Brands

- Target is Ecommerce Brands or Software Companies.
- Saw a guy run this up to $30k/mo in 30 days (he used to run different businesses so there was competence) by doing the following:
- Made a giant thread of "30 days of ads" where he would post static image ad design for brands, then tag the founders and the brands. It was done in the same thread.
- Made TikTok videos of him actively designing ads inside Figma (this was smart).

**Productized Service Biz 3**: Ghost Writing Social Media Posts

- All the guys Daniel seen successfully do this have done it through inbound leads (this means the leads come to you)
- If you are going to get ghostwriting clients to help people grow on Twitter (or LinkedIn) - you need a lot of followers.
- [Dakota Robertson](https://www.dakotarobertson.net/) is an example of this.
- He has been doing it so long he basically designed a system to always be viral (and he is the Twitter coach in Client Ascension)
- Again, follow the Twitter Masterclass of Daniel.

**Productized Service Biz 4**: Design Agency

- Daniels brother does this
- Makes nice visuals on Twitter and Instagram
- People come to him organically and have him design posts for their profiles
- Follow the Twitter Masterclass.

**Productized Service Biz 5**: Youtube Video Editing

- Daniel found his editor because he tweeted that he was going to start on Youtube
- He got a message from the guy telling him he's an editor and he sent links to his work
- If you don't already have work done, follow this:

1. Find people in business niche with unedited videos who ALREADY have videos on Youtube. Find them on Twitter, Instagram or email.
2. Send them a message like "Hey {name}, Just watched your video on Youtube about X and loved what you said about y. Wanted to send over a message because I think your channel could pop off with proper editing, keyword research and thumbnails. Are you going to make more videos soon? (I'd be happy to edit your first for free)" (If they do not respond, follow up. Follow up until you get a yes or no)
3. When they post the edited video you make, come bacj to them after a couple days with bunch of more video ideas you source from VidIQ (keyword research)

This is currently around $400 - $800 per video.

**Productized Service Biz 6**: Influencer Marketing

- Target is ecom brands
- Service is getting them ads made by TikTok influencers
- Cold email a bunch of ecommerce brands (you can get their emails from something like contactecom.com or storeleads.com) 
- Email script like "Hey {name}, quick question, are you guys looking for UGC ads from TikTok influencers? I can get 10-20 videos made for {{x product}}"
- Charge brands anywhere between $100-$400 per video.
- Find UGC influencer on Twitter by going into Twitter Search Bar and simply typing "UGC" - there is a big community there.

## Scale to 100k/mo

[How to Scale a Marketing Agency to $100k/mo (FREE COURSE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8CmTiA-Ks) - 4 March 2025

One of the latest videos in the channel. Done for you.

Table of contents as follows:

### Offers

#### Market Demand

Making an Irresistible Offer That Sells to **Cold Traffic**.

You have to make an offer that sells to cold traffic. Not warm.

!!! tip

    Did you get that part?
    
    Cold Traffic do not buy:

    - Measurement implementation for e-commerce brands

    they are buying:

    - Implementation of a webinar funnel so that they could make money. Not data analytics.

#### Concrete Results

!!! example

    "We'll build you a quiz funnel for your cold traffic ads that will double your qualified leads."

    is a specific and result-focused offer.

    "We provide comprehensive digital marketing services"

    is NOT.

Daniel restructured an offer to:

!!! example

    "13 quote ready remodeling projects booked into your calender in the next 90 days using AI-powered SEO and free ad management"

    Notice the specificity - 13 projects, 90 days, using specific tech.

#### Clear Value Proposition

Trying to make a complex service that bundles 5-10 different services together can be overwhelming for the client.

!!! example

    One guy was trying to sell tech management, growth marketing, lead intake all bundled together.

    Cold email will never respond to - "Do you need someone to manage your technology?"

    Instead of that, identify one offer that will get people to raise their hand and book a call.

    For most cold traffic that would be:

    - AI-focused offers. (they are novel)

    - Growth marketing with quantifiable claim

    - Something with a unique guarantee

The rest of the services can be sold **AFTER** - NOT BEFORE - **AFTER** you've required the customer.

!!! tip

    This is what Daniel does in ListKit. People come in for cold email and they are cross sold to other services.

!!! note "banger"

    People have different things as what they want and need.

    They might actually **need** tech management and lead intake etc.

    What they want, is more customers.

    So what they need does not matter in this perspective.

    Banger incoming:

    ***Once you sell them what they want, you can sell them what they need later.***


You get cold traffic in the door with a cold traffic offer - and then LATER ON sell them what they actually need.

!!! tip

    Everyone NEEDS to go to the gym and eat healthy food, but they want Ozempic.

    There is a reason broccoli farmers aren't billionaires and makers of Ozempic are.

#### Appropriate Pricing

If you do not have a ton of case studies yet, you cannot charge premium prices to cold traffic.

It won't convert. You need to match your pricing to your perceived authority in the market.

!!! tip

    Here is a banger.

    A student in CA who was trying to sell a $10k package with a 90-day guarantee but only had 7% close rate.

    A 7% close rate is a massive indicator that you are overpriced.
    
    Your pricing should be at a level that you exactly close between 18-30% of your calls.

    If it's any lower, you are charging too much money in relation to your level of authority.

You need to be realistic about what your level of authority is.

Daniel advised this student to lower his price temporarily until he builds more case studies.

This is not forever. It's a strategic move to get more clients in the door, build case studies then raise your prices as your authority increases.

#### Guarantee Structure

With less authority, you need a stronger guarantee.

If you are just starting out, you might have to start with a performance based model or a strong money back guarantee.

As authority increases you can shift to less risky structures for you.

!!! tip

    Remember, guarantee is there to compensate for lack of case studies.

    If you have 50 amazing testimonials, you don't need as strong of a guarantee.

- Less Authority: Stronger Guarantee Required

- More Authority: Less Requirement for a Guarantee

#### New Opportunities

It's tough to sell "I can do your current marketing better than you can."

They have to admit that they are doing poorly, and you have to be dramatically better to justify the cost.

This typically also results in situations where you are trying to pitch people who actively believe they're better than you.

For instance, Daniel gets ton of people pitching me to write emails to his list or come up with his YouTube content.

99% of the time this comes from somebody who doesn't even have their own their YouTube channel and their own email list.

!!! warning

    In this case, all the evidence points to Daniel being better than them.
    
    And paying them money to do if for Daniel would actively result in Daniel getting worse results.

Instead, focus on solving new problems or making new opportunities.

"I will build a quiz funnel for cold traffic is making a new revenue stream, not replacing an existing one. Much easier to sell."

***You ideally want to make something new for them!***

!!! example

    You sell YouTube Management or Content Marketing.

    ❌ Bad Offer: Targeting People Who Already Do Well on Youtube

    ✅ Better Offer: Targeting People Who Already Do Well on Another Platform but DO NOT use Youtube

It's always easier to get somebody to Start something new as opposed to selling them something that IMPROVES something they already do.

!!! tip

    All of this content in Offers is a **Requirement** for anything else in the rest of the course.


#### The Summary For Offers**:

- **Market Demand** - Offer is something the market already wants to buy.
- **Concrete Results** - Offer delivers concrete, specific results.
- **Clear Value Proposition** - Offer focuses on one clear value proposition for front-end acquisition.
- **Appropriate Pricing** - Offer is priced appropriately for your authority level.
- **Guarantee Structure** - Offer has the right guarantee structure in relation to your authority level.
- **New Opportunities** - Offer makes new opportunities rather than replacing existing functions.

If you get this right, you have laid the foundations to scale.

### Marketing Channels

Once you have an offer that converts the next question is: 

"How do you get it in front of the right people?"

The answer changes depending on where you are in your growth journey.

Here are the stages:

#### Stage 1

This is where you are at $0-$10k per month.

Your primary goal is to get your first 5-10 client and build case studies.

You have a limited time and no marketing budget.

!!! tip

    Let's make this clear.

    FIRST: Get Case Studies

    SECOND: Make Money

    If you try to put making money BEFORE getting case studies, you end up with less money.


Here is what works best:

- **Manual Outreach** - Dream 100 strategics where you're identifying perfect-fit prospects and doing personalized outreach.

- **Cold Email** - Despite what you might hear, cold email works, and when done right, with the right offer to the right target audience.

All deliverability & spam problems are a result of people actively marking you as spam.

If you have a good offer and send it to a relevant audience, they simply do not mark you as spam and therefore your results are therefore better.

This fundamentally does not work without a good offer.

- **Linkedin**

Both content and direct outreach can work here, but make sure you are posting consistently (5x per week) and doing targeted outreach to people who engage.

Keep them simple:

!!! example

    Hey {{name}}, are you interested in AI Cold Callers?

#### Stage 2

I am not here yet. 

So:

TODO

#### Stage 3

Not here yet.

TODO.


### Leveraging AI

TODO

#### First

- Making Content and Repurposing:

You can literally find content ideas with the prompt:

"I'm working with a client runs X business and wants to start Youtube Content. Generate 20 video ideas targeting high-intent keywords their audience would be searching for."

- Extract Core Lessons from Existing Content

Upload transcripts of sales calls, consulting calls, client or networking calls.

Ask it to extract the core lessons and principles from the conversations. Then direct it to format these lessons & principles into content for Linkedin or Twitter or Email list.

- Youtube Video Repurposing

Input a Youtube video link to get the transcript.

Upload to LLM. Give it a prompt like this:

"You've been given a transcript from one of my recent Youtube videos. I want you to make 10 tweets based on these lessons from this Youtube Video. The tweets should be written to independently perform well."

#### Second

Sales Script and Email Generation.

You can literally take top performing content with a transcriber,

### Building Systems

### Building Market Authority

### Action Steps

If you are at $0-$10k a month:

- Make a winning offer: Focus on making one front-end offer that actually sells to cold traffic.

- Manual Outreach - Implement manual outreach through Dream 100 and cold email

- Content Creation - Start making content that establishes your expertise

- Build Case Studies - Focus on getting 5-10 solid case studies.
