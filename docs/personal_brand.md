# Personal Brand

## Personal Brand from the Glossary

Only way to sell at Market Sophistication Level 5.

You have claim, risk reversal, evidence AND you need to do content marketing that gives upfront value. If you do not do this, when market sophisticates, business will die.

What do I make content on?

- Giving value. You are showing people how to facilitate. What is is that you do?

- They could do it themselves theocratically, however, you are selling to business owners. When they consume this value based content, they are not thinking "I'm going to do this myself" it's like vetting for you, "let me see this guys process".

It just shows competence.

You become the default of it. ***Become the default man.***

Daniel banger:

> Who else will do a webflow series, unless you are a webflow expert.

It's **the association**. You have to be an expert if you post a video on Youtube because every other expert does post a video on Youtube.  

> "Only experts gon on podcasts, so if you are on a podcast, you have to be an expert." That's the thinking pattern.

## Risk & Reward

[Risk & Reward: How to Bet on Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfPiG96S0zI) - 28 December 2023

Let's understand the game.

Your entrepreneurial business is a capital return machine.

Take money, take mental frameworks and models and make sure your venture is able to have the highest return on capital possible.

3 ways to get clients

- **Content** is %100 time.

- **Cold outreach** is little bit of capital and mostly time.

- **Ads** are mostly just capital. 

but this is also true:

- **Content** compounds through followers and authenticity.

- **Cold outreach** is linear.

- **Ads** compound through monopolized attention.

You can only scale content and cold outreach to a local maximums.

### You cannot be able to substantially scale without taking on more capital risk.

Producing content and cold outreach is really comfortable for starters because your perception of time is low.

### You only have so much capital, it's a finite resource. Therefore it must be allocated to the most efficient vehicle possible.

Use is wisely.

### Scrolling on Social

Let's say there is BIllion DAU - each user can get 100 ads in average

It's a 100 Billion pieces of real estate per day. It is fixed.

On social, you are the product, your attention is being sold.

So attention monopolies work with getting the most real estate possible.

Understand this: Compounding effect of purchasing assets also works on attention monopolies.

## Daniel's Story

!!! tip

    This is Video #1 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How I Made $2,500,000 By 25 | My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W16bvJvcTLk) - 15 July 2022

### Part 1 Pre Cold Email Wizard.

#### Amazon FBA

Daniel started with Amazon FBA.

30-40 Youtube videos with pen an paper, just like what I'm doing right now!

At the right time he was selling the right thing!

Nothing was the same after.

He needed a way to make money **without using capital**.

#### Marketing Agency

You just find businesses, that's the %90 of your job.

Cold emails from Gmail, no domain.

15% of the ad spend on Facebook ads with:

    - Special cards to get drink deals on special days. This worked really well.

[You need to be minimally viably competent on basically every single thing.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=308)

Daniel met some marketing agency people driving Maserati's.

As an actually intelligent person would do, Daniel:

- Look at their page.
- Figure out their service
- Find out what they are charging

And said:

> I know for a fact that I can run the client acquisition better than these people.

And he did.

#### Instagram Agency

This doesn't work anymore, but it was basically follow on follow.

You would follow then unfollow people.

- $97/mo for 500 followers per month

- $147/mo for 1000 followers per month

He emailed 300-400 of fitness coaches at 10 mil followers, **offering work for free** just to have results on my landing page.

He got 5 people.

Here is the fact.

Daniel was manually going through Instagram hashtags and sending out personalized emails 3 hours per day every single day.

That business got to $12k/mo in 4 months.

Instagram got an algorithm update and destroys the entire business overnight.

#### Lead Gen Agency

> I built this Instagram agency using cold email, I am just going to sell what got me here, cold email as a service.

Getting on phone with some real agencies.

Daniel was selling $2k/mo packages and guaranteeing 10 phone calls. It was working pretty well.

Starting to learn CRM's. How to be better at sales calls. High ticket deals can take more than 1 call. Conversion windows.

All the big boy stuff.

[I like to gather attention. I like to generate the phone call, I don't like to execute the phone call in the sales system.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=563)

Low priced course on how to execute cold email campaigns.

"I will put the purchases through a follow up sequence and sign them as clients, they are already going to be presold by the time they get to the phone."

### Part 2 Cold Email Wizard.

#### The agency and software

Daniel takes off on Twitter.

Here is the question:

> "How can I scale this and make the most amount of money possible?" 

He was pointing the people all the software that he was not in charge of.

So he decided why not own these softwares that people use while learning cold emailing.

[ContactEcom was made using Webflow](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/ContactEcom-Landing-Page-Template).

> The latest re-design of the newest email marketing and scraping software. SaaS product designed by the Cold Email Wizard and SaaS Wiz on Twitter. Feel free to clone the landing page!

Klean Leads was made too (no longer in service).

They instantly made $20k/mo.

**Mailerrize** for sending cold emails, **quicklines.ai** for auto writing personalized lines into first sentence of cold email, **scrapeinfo** leads scraped form Instagram.

> Running and agency is a phenomenal way to make $60k/mo - $80k/mo but a miserable way to make $200k/mo, so he stopped doing agency.

#### Client Ascension

Help people get from $5k/mo to $50k/mo - $80k/mo.

There are 3 things you can sell:

- DIY (Do it yourself) - courses, software

- DWY (Done with you) - coaching/consulting

- DFY (Done for you) - Agency, hybrid DFY/DWY

Things get at $150k/mo+

So the market when through all the shifts:

- Courses
- High Ticket Coaching
- Hybrid DFY/DWY

You can charge more because the buyer already knows the puzzle piece that they are missing.

They are already sold on the idea. **They are buying speed.**

Here is how things work:

1. Guys below $5k/mo buy courses and low priced memberships

2. Guys $5k - $50k/mo buy coaching

3. Guys $50k/mo+ buy hybrid DFY/DWY and also masterminds (coaching)

4. Everybody buys software

Here is a banger.

> %80 of intelligent business owners don't want to rely on an agency so you might as well have a hybrid done-with-you-done-for-you offer.

People will pay you to design systems in house.

They will buy productized services (design this email, edit this video).

Not "do all the lead generation in the entirely if my company".

!!! example

    Smart customer will say something like this:

    "You are doing great. I think we want to own the expertise (take it in house). I want to replicate this knowledge to other people continuously."

    If you are running an agency, this is what's going to happen all the time.

    So you need a hybrid DWY service.

    If you are smart, you should say:

    "I understand you want to take this in house. How about whoever you go hire, you can buy consulting from me, I will teach them how to do it."

    Now you've extracted more LTV (who was going to churn anyway).

    You need to sell everything.

Here is another banger:

> Your income level is directly proportional to how much social proof you have.

This is simply exponential thing.

Wake up.

## Twitter Masterclass

!!! tip

    This is Video #3 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Twitter Masterclass: Step-By-Step How To Grow Followers & Make Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdn-lLZ-og) - 27 September 2022

Step by step.

Follow this.

If you are not saying anything interesting, giving any value or teaching people things you will not get followers regardless of how much engagement you do.

A banger:

[The person on the journey is equally as interesting as the person who has already completed it](https://youtu.be/aSdn-lLZ-og?t=190).

### 0 - 300 Followers

At least 2 tweets per day.

One very good, information giving and valuable thread pinned on your profile.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

> These comments cannot be just rewords of what somebody has already said. You must inject your own anecdotes, your own experience or ADD to what they said.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

### 300 - 1000 Followers

At least 2 tweets per day.

At least 1 thread per week.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

### 3000 - 10000 Followers

At least 3 tweets per day.

At least 1 thread per week.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

Just do more. The flywheel.

### Cardinal Rules

- If you are below 1000 followers, tweeting more will not get you more followers because there's nobody to see your tweets.

- If you are below 1000 followers, the biggest driving facotr is the amount of outbound comments you're making.

- As you grow followers, the amount of tweets you put out becomes increasingly more important and outbound comments become less important.

- Responding to all comments on tweets you have, push your tweet back onto the timeline of your followers who are actively on Twitter - thus further increasing the likelihood of engagement on said tweet (do not underestimate this - you MUST do this).

### Follow Conversion Rate

The amount of people that visit your profile divided by how many of those followers visited you.

People only follow you:

- They believe that following you will result in them learning new things
- They are entertained by you
- You have credibility

Your follow conversion rate will be determined by:
- Your bio
- Your pinned tweet

Your bio should do three things:
- State what your account is about
- State any credibility you have
- Call to Action

Your pinned tweet should be either:
- Very Valuable Thread
- A direct link to your offer

### Grow ridiculously fast

Maximize your follow conversion rate. See your analytics at [this page](https://x.com/i/account_analytics).

    - No exceptions. There is no point in making comments, tweets, threads if you are not clearly showing & convincing why people should be following you. You are Burning opportunities. Every single person that visits your profile is an opportunity to gain a follower. This number must be as high as conceivably possible, or everything else you are doing is a waste of time.
    
    - You must be extremely clear about what your profile is about or who you are. If you don't know what you profile is about, say What you plan is. "21 year old attempting his first $10k in the next 6 months. Documenting the journey. Follow me and watch it." 

Increase the amount of outbound comments to 20-40 per day. Space it throughout the day.

When above 1000 followers increase the amount of tweets to 5 per day.

When above 1000 followers increase to 2 threads per week.

### Tools and Tips

Daniel started with TweetHunter.

Join with a link from Daniel's affiliate link [here](https://tweethunter.io/?via=daniel-fazio).

Bookmark your best tweet's and add some of those to **Evergreen** in Tweet Hunter. See the [example here](https://youtu.be/aSdn-lLZ-og?t=609).

Just copy a link of your tweet and add them to Evergreen.

When an Evergreen slot hits in calendar, it takes a tweet from the pool and retweets it automatically.

You can manually schedule a tweet on **Hypefury** as well, here is the [affiliate link](https://hypefury.com/?via=daniel41).

Auto DM's are powerful.

On X/Twitter, you can simply be smart.

On your calendar with Hypefury or Tweet Hunter, you just setup an Auto DM.

Meaning you promise to deliver something to people that likes and or retweets something.

And the tool automatically sends a DM to people who actually does that thing, which is your promise. A link to something valuable.

If you are smart, this could be an opt in, you get your email list going.

### Buying Retweets

You could actually do this, Daniel used to do it. 

But retweets from big accounts.

> Retweets from a 40k account should be worth about $35 each.

A lot of guys charge anywhere between $750 - $1500 for batches of 30 retweets which you contacted from Telegram.

This is just screenshots so Twitter couldn't see the source.

You also have to space it out.

If you are not putting out good content, nobody will sell retweets to you, as expected.

### Making Content

#### Competence Tweets

These shows you know what you're talking about and providing why people should follow you.

Your pinned tweet should be your best competence proving tweet/thread.

!!! example

    Testimonials.

    You just take testimonials and retweet with your link.

another one

!!! example

    Case Studies

    Show how you do stuff, with a thread.


and another one

!!! example

    Proof of Skill

    Show some stripe or gumroad thing.

    I did this.

another one.

!!! example

    Achievements

    Show what you achieved.


another one.

!!! example

    Humble Flexes

    "1m$ on Gumroad yesterday - 80k followers on Twitter today.
    
    You all are too kind
    
    Ily.


#### Engagement Tweets

For the function of gathering attention in the first place.

NEVER stray too far into the path "posting solely to get engagement"

Daniel ALWAYS tweets in his voice.

I repeat.

This is important.

**ALWAYS tweet in your voice.**

If you have a small account, you SHOULD make engagement tweets.

You get a lot of traffic.

!!! warning

    If you only post engagement tweets you will get an audience that only likes engagement tweets.

    Those people do not buy things.

The ideal mix is %20 sales tweets, %65 competence/threads and 15% engagement tweets.

Find the big idea and reword it.

#### Sales Tweets

Direct calls to action pointing people somewhere.

Can run these tweets as ads to your own followers.
