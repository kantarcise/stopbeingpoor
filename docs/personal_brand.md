# Personal Brand

## Personal Brand from the Glossary

Only way to sell at Market Sophistication Level 5.

You have claim, risk reversal, evidence AND you need to do content marketing that gives upfront value. If you do not do this, when market sophisticates, business will die.

What do I make content on?

- Giving value. You are showing people how to facilitate. What is is that you do?

- They could do it themselves theocratically, however, you are selling to business owners. When they consume this value based content, they are not thinking "I'm going to do this myself" it's like vetting for you, "let me see this guys process".

It just shows competence.

You become the default of it. ***Become the default man.***

Daniel banger:

> Who else will do a webflow series, unless you are a webflow expert.

It's **the association**. You have to be an expert if you post a video on Youtube because every other expert does post a video on Youtube.  

> "Only experts gon on podcasts, so if you are on a podcast, you have to be an expert." That's the thinking pattern.

## Risk & Reward

[Risk & Reward: How to Bet on Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfPiG96S0zI) - 28 December 2023

Let's understand the game.

Your entrepreneurial business is a capital return machine.

Take money, take mental frameworks and models and make sure your venture is able to have the highest return on capital possible.

3 ways to get clients

- **Content** is %100 time.

- **Cold outreach** is little bit of capital and mostly time.

- **Ads** are mostly just capital. 

but this is also true:

- **Content** compounds through followers and authenticity.

- **Cold outreach** is linear.

- **Ads** compound through monopolized attention.

You can only scale content and cold outreach to a local maximums.

### You cannot be able to substantially scale without taking on more capital risk.

Producing content and cold outreach is really comfortable for starters because your perception of time is low.

### You only have so much capital, it's a finite resource. Therefore it must be allocated to the most efficient vehicle possible.

Use is wisely.

### Scrolling on Social

Let's say there is BIllion DAU - each user can get 100 ads in average

It's a 100 Billion pieces of real estate per day. It is fixed.

On social, you are the product, your attention is being sold.

So attention monopolies work with getting the most real estate possible.

Understand this: Compounding effect of purchasing assets also works on attention monopolies.

## Daniel's Story

!!! tip

    This is Video #1 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How I Made $2,500,000 By 25 | My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W16bvJvcTLk) - 15 July 2022

### Part 1 Pre Cold Email Wizard.

#### Amazon FBA

Daniel started with Amazon FBA.

30-40 Youtube videos with pen an paper, just like what I'm doing right now!

At the right time he was selling the right thing!

Nothing was the same after.

He needed a way to make money **without using capital**.

#### Marketing Agency

You just find businesses, that's the %90 of your job.

Cold emails from Gmail, no domain.

15% of the ad spend on Facebook ads with:

    - Special cards to get drink deals on special days. This worked really well.

[You need to be minimally viably competent on basically every single thing.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=308)

Daniel met some marketing agency people driving Maserati's.

As an actually intelligent person would do, Daniel:

- Look at their page.
- Figure out their service
- Find out what they are charging

And said:

> I know for a fact that I can run the client acquisition better than these people.

And he did.

#### Instagram Agency

This doesn't work anymore, but it was basically follow on follow.

You would follow then unfollow people.

- $97/mo for 500 followers per month

- $147/mo for 1000 followers per month

He emailed 300-400 of fitness coaches at 10 mil followers, **offering work for free** just to have results on my landing page.

He got 5 people.

Here is the fact.

Daniel was manually going through Instagram hashtags and sending out personalized emails 3 hours per day every single day.

That business got to $12k/mo in 4 months.

Instagram got an algorithm update and destroys the entire business overnight.

#### Lead Gen Agency

> I built this Instagram agency using cold email, I am just going to sell what got me here, cold email as a service.

Getting on phone with some real agencies.

Daniel was selling $2k/mo packages and guaranteeing 10 phone calls. It was working pretty well.

Starting to learn CRM's. How to be better at sales calls. High ticket deals can take more than 1 call. Conversion windows.

All the big boy stuff.

[I like to gather attention. I like to generate the phone call, I don't like to execute the phone call in the sales system.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=563)

Low priced course on how to execute cold email campaigns.

"I will put the purchases through a follow up sequence and sign them as clients, they are already going to be presold by the time they get to the phone."

### Part 2 Cold Email Wizard.

#### The agency and software

Daniel takes off on Twitter.

Here is the question:

> "How can I scale this and make the most amount of money possible?" 

He was pointing the people all the software that he was not in charge of.

So he decided why not own these softwares that people use while learning cold emailing.

[ContactEcom was made using Webflow](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/ContactEcom-Landing-Page-Template).

> The latest re-design of the newest email marketing and scraping software. SaaS product designed by the Cold Email Wizard and SaaS Wiz on Twitter. Feel free to clone the landing page!

Klean Leads was made too (no longer in service).

They instantly made $20k/mo.

**Mailerrize** for sending cold emails, **quicklines.ai** for auto writing personalized lines into first sentence of cold email, **scrapeinfo** leads scraped form Instagram.

> Running and agency is a phenomenal way to make $60k/mo - $80k/mo but a miserable way to make $200k/mo, so he stopped doing agency.

#### Client Ascension

Help people get from $5k/mo to $50k/mo - $80k/mo.

There are 3 things you can sell:

- DIY (Do it yourself) - courses, software

- DWY (Done with you) - coaching/consulting

- DFY (Done for you) - Agency, hybrid DFY/DWY

Things get at $150k/mo+

So the market when through all the shifts:

- Courses
- High Ticket Coaching
- Hybrid DFY/DWY

You can charge more because the buyer already knows the puzzle piece that they are missing.

They are already sold on the idea. **They are buying speed.**

Here is how things work:

1. Guys below $5k/mo buy courses and low priced memberships

2. Guys $5k - $50k/mo buy coaching

3. Guys $50k/mo+ buy hybrid DFY/DWY and also masterminds (coaching)

4. Everybody buys software

Here is a banger.

> %80 of intelligent business owners don't want to rely on an agency so you might as well have a hybrid done-with-you-done-for-you offer.

People will pay you to design systems in house.

They will buy productized services (design this email, edit this video).

Not "do all the lead generation in the entirely if my company".

!!! example

    Smart customer will say something like this:

    "You are doing great. I think we want to own the expertise (take it in house). I want to replicate this knowledge to other people continuously."

    If you are running an agency, this is what's going to happen all the time.

    So you need a hybrid DWY service.

    If you are smart, you should say:

    "I understand you want to take this in house. How about whoever you go hire, you can buy consulting from me, I will teach them how to do it."

    Now you've extracted more LTV (who was going to churn anyway).

    You need to sell everything.

Here is another banger:

> Your income level is directly proportional to how much social proof you have.

This is simply exponential thing.

Wake up.

## Twitter Masterclass

!!! tip

    This is Video #3 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Twitter Masterclass: Step-By-Step How To Grow Followers & Make Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdn-lLZ-og) - 27 September 2022

Step by step.

Follow this.

If you are not saying anything interesting, giving any value or teaching people things you will not get followers regardless of how much engagement you do.

A banger:

[The person on the journey is equally as interesting as the person who has already completed it](https://youtu.be/aSdn-lLZ-og?t=190).

### 0 - 300 Followers

At least 2 tweets per day.

One very good, information giving and valuable thread pinned on your profile.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

> These comments cannot be just rewords of what somebody has already said. You must inject your own anecdotes, your own experience or ADD to what they said.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

### 300 - 1000 Followers

At least 2 tweets per day.

At least 1 thread per week.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

### 3000 - 10000 Followers

At least 3 tweets per day.

At least 1 thread per week.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

Just do more. The flywheel.

### Cardinal Rules

- If you are below 1000 followers, tweeting more will not get you more followers because there's nobody to see your tweets.

- If you are below 1000 followers, the biggest driving facotr is the amount of outbound comments you're making.

- As you grow followers, the amount of tweets you put out becomes increasingly more important and outbound comments become less important.

- Responding to all comments on tweets you have, push your tweet back onto the timeline of your followers who are actively on Twitter - thus further increasing the likelihood of engagement on said tweet (do not underestimate this - you MUST do this).

### Follow Conversion Rate

The amount of people that visit your profile divided by how many of those followers visited you.

People only follow you:

- They believe that following you will result in them learning new things
- They are entertained by you
- You have credibility

Your follow conversion rate will be determined by:
- Your bio
- Your pinned tweet

Your bio should do three things:
- State what your account is about
- State any credibility you have
- Call to Action

Your pinned tweet should be either:
- Very Valuable Thread
- A direct link to your offer

### Grow ridiculously fast

Maximize your follow conversion rate. See your analytics at [this page](https://x.com/i/account_analytics).

    - No exceptions. There is no point in making comments, tweets, threads if you are not clearly showing & convincing why people should be following you. You are Burning opportunities. Every single person that visits your profile is an opportunity to gain a follower. This number must be as high as conceivably possible, or everything else you are doing is a waste of time.
    
    - You must be extremely clear about what your profile is about or who you are. If you don't know what you profile is about, say What you plan is. "21 year old attempting his first $10k in the next 6 months. Documenting the journey. Follow me and watch it." 

Increase the amount of outbound comments to 20-40 per day. Space it throughout the day.

When above 1000 followers increase the amount of tweets to 5 per day.

When above 1000 followers increase to 2 threads per week.

### Tools and Tips

Daniel started with TweetHunter.

Join with a link from Daniel's affiliate link [here](https://tweethunter.io/?via=daniel-fazio).

Bookmark your best tweet's and add some of those to **Evergreen** in Tweet Hunter. See the [example here](https://youtu.be/aSdn-lLZ-og?t=609).

Just copy a link of your tweet and add them to Evergreen.

When an Evergreen slot hits in calendar, it takes a tweet from the pool and retweets it automatically.

You can manually schedule a tweet on **Hypefury** as well, here is the [affiliate link](https://hypefury.com/?via=daniel41).

Auto DM's are powerful.

On X/Twitter, you can simply be smart.

On your calendar with Hypefury or Tweet Hunter, you just setup an Auto DM.

Meaning you promise to deliver something to people that likes and or retweets something.

And the tool automatically sends a DM to people who actually does that thing, which is your promise. A link to something valuable.

If you are smart, this could be an opt in, you get your email list going.

### Buying Retweets

You could actually do this, Daniel used to do it. 

But retweets from big accounts.

> Retweets from a 40k account should be worth about $35 each.

A lot of guys charge anywhere between $750 - $1500 for batches of 30 retweets which you contacted from Telegram.

This is just screenshots so Twitter couldn't see the source.

You also have to space it out.

If you are not putting out good content, nobody will sell retweets to you, as expected.

### Making Content

#### Competence Tweets

These shows you know what you're talking about and providing why people should follow you.

Your pinned tweet should be your best competence proving tweet/thread.

!!! example

    Testimonials.

    You just take testimonials and retweet with your link.

another one

!!! example

    Case Studies

    Show how you do stuff, with a thread.


and another one

!!! example

    Proof of Skill

    Show some stripe or gumroad thing.

    I did this.

another one.

!!! example

    Achievements

    Show what you achieved.


another one.

!!! example

    Humble Flexes

    "1m$ on Gumroad yesterday - 80k followers on Twitter today.
    
    You all are too kind
    
    Ily.


#### Engagement Tweets

For the function of gathering attention in the first place.

NEVER stray too far into the path "posting solely to get engagement"

Daniel ALWAYS tweets in his voice.

I repeat.

This is important.

**ALWAYS tweet in your voice.**

If you have a small account, you SHOULD make engagement tweets.

You get a lot of traffic.

!!! warning

    If you only post engagement tweets you will get an audience that only likes engagement tweets.

    Those people do not buy things.

The ideal mix is %20 sales tweets, %65 competence/threads and 15% engagement tweets.

Find the big idea and reword it.

Daniel told you can pause the video and take screenshots of it.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Engagement Tweets 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_one.png)
  <figcaption>Engagement Tweets 1</figcaption>
</figure>

You just find the **big idea** of the tweet, and reword it.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Engagement Tweets 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_two.png)
  <figcaption>Engagement Tweets 2</figcaption>
</figure>

You just find the **big idea** of the tweet, and reword it.

Don't ever copy people. Think foy 

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Engagement Tweets 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Engagement Tweets 3 </figcaption>
</figure>

You just find the **big idea** of the tweet, and reword it.

I know I repeated this 3 times.

It is the important sentence.

#### Sales Tweets

Direct calls to action pointing people somewhere.

Can run these tweets as ads to your own followers.

Here are some screenshots to get the ideas.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Sales Tweet 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 1 </figcaption>

Straight up selling.

  ![Sales Tweet 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 2 </figcaption>

With claim, as expected.

  ![Sales Tweet 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 3 </figcaption>

Claim wording is critical.

  ![Sales Tweet 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 4 </figcaption>
</figure>

This was the internet money sale.

### Threads

The entire performance of a thread will be dictated upon the first tweet, and more particularly the first sentence.

You NEED to learn how headlines are written, and Daniel recommends the book by [Michael Masterson "Great Leads"](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Leads-Easiest-Start-Message-ebook/dp/B007I6MEUI).


**Bad Thread**: "My first writing client paid me X. My last one paid me Y. Here is what changed."

**Good Thread**: "The automated onboarding flow that has increased my ecom client's revenue by 30% in just 60 days."

See an example:

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Thread Tweet 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/thread_tweet_one.png)
  <figcaption>Thread Tweet 1 </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Thread Topics

> **Less Time**: “How I went from benching 225 to 300 pounds only working out 3 times per week within just 72 days”  

> **Less Effort**: “Here’s how I make 7 threads, 10 LinkedIn posts, 8 Instagram Reels, and 9 TikToks from just one single video”

> **Handling the Objections Your Audience Has**: “A lot of agencies think cold email won’t work for them if they’re not charging $3,000 a month or more. But it does actually work, and I’ll explain how in this thread”  

> **Answering the Questions Your Audience Has**: “How do I X?” — Answer it

### Stealing Content

You could steal content (not steal but be a detective really).

Just know that there is a [Twitter Advanced Search](https://x.com/search-advanced).

### Why Respond DM's

70%-90% of your DM's will be people asking questions in regards to content you have just posted.

This is the source of how you make new content.

### Reword your own tweets

Go into Twitter advanced search and search your best performing tweets between particular dates and reword them

You can also do this with other people's profiles.

### Increasing Engagement

Respond to all comments on your tweets. This continuously pushes your tweet higher.

Twitter is a feed. If you interact with a tweet it pushes it back to the top for other people.

Responding to all comment on your tweet automatically doubles the comment count of every post (this is true of every social media post, Daniel does this on Youtube and Instagram aswell). 

Here’s the full text from the image:
 
### Call to Actions

The entire function of all of this is to point people somewhere.

You SHOULD not be doing this unless you're pointing somebody somewhere.

1. If you have your product figured out → point them to a landing page

2. If you haven’t have your product figured out → point them to follow you
   
    a. “If you liked this tweet, would really appreciate a follow as I’ll be putting out more content like this regularly!”
  
    b. “If you liked this thread, throw me a follow and comment your questions below! I’ll be making more threads this week and would love your inputs”

Do this. It works.

## Interview with Brooke - Client Ascension Member

!!! tip

    This is Video #7 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Brook Made $55,000 in Two Months (Agency Owner Interview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ubUWUIHN0I) - 14 October 2022

**Daniel:** What's up everybody! I’ve got Top G Brooke here. He’s been in Client Ascension for around 4–5 months. How you doing brother?

**Brooke:** Good brother, how are you?

**Daniel:** Phenomenal. Let's start with a quick intro—what do you do, what are you selling, how much are you making right now?

**Brooke:**

* I started an e-commerce store about a year ago.
* We’ve done $3.7M in the past year.
* I've stepped out of the business recently—team runs it.
* Now I’m focusing on advertising and started from scratch when I joined Client Ascension.

### Business Model

* **Coaching Program:**

  * Helps people build a store from scratch.
  * Goal: get them successful enough to transition into the agency.
  * Fully structured Ascension model: a product for every stage.

* **Agency Growth Partner Offer:**

  * We target stores smaller than mine.
  * Help scale them with email marketing, Google Ads, Facebook Ads.
  * Flexible depending on the store’s needs.
  * If I can’t help, I refer within the Client Ascension network.

**Daniel:** You've basically cloned the Client Ascension model. Course first, then agency. Have something to sell at every level.

### Revenue and Growth

* **Month 1 (August):** $30K (mostly coaching)
* **Month 2 (September):** $25K (mostly agency)
* Goal: $50–60K by November/December
* Launching a more formal agency structure soon

### Content Strategy

* Collaboration with Connor:

  * Rapid-fire Q&A sessions for content.
  * Send each other list of questions and hop on a call to answer.
  * Not podcast-style, just high-output content clips.

* **Lead Sources:**

  * Coaching clients: Twitter inbound
  * Agency clients: cold email (learned via Client Ascension)

**Brooke:** Cold email brought in all agency clients. I knew nothing about it before CA.

### Offers and Pricing

* Currently testing a **performance-based pricing model**:

  * Take a baseline from past revenue
  * Earn 25% of the increase
  * Requires clients to provide access & execute quickly

* **Challenges:**

  * Clients delay giving ad account access or creative assets
  * Considering adding deadlines & minimum retainers for compliance

### Fulfillment and Scaling

* **Strengths:**

  * Google Ads, website conversion

* **Weak areas:**

  * Email marketing (outsourced within CA)

* Current agency structure:

  * \$3K setup fee → used for fulfillment outsourcing

* **Future Plan:**

  * Focus on coaching to attract better agency clients (trust will already be there)
  * Potential private equity-style deals
  * Build fulfillment team when agency hits $50K/month

### Operational Challenges

* At $25K/month, fulfillment is overwhelming
* Needs SOPs, Looms, defined roles
* Working on team-building with Andre’s help

You have to really precise on what the person has to do, basically train them as if they are are your coaching student.

> "Every SOP you make is a 10x ROI in two months."

**Daniel:** Most people don’t pass $50K/month because they can’t scale fulfillment.

### Advice for New Agency Owners

**Brooke:**

1) **Have a skill**—doesn’t matter what, just be good at something.

2) **Volume matters**—contact thousands.

3) **Analyze your performance:**

  * A/B test scripts
  * Double down on what works
  * Always optimize

> "Send 5,000 emails. 3 people will say yes."

* Don’t use overused lead magnets/scripts—write your own
* You don't just get people hopping on a call. When you get responses, what should you do?
* Learn to manage the full sales cycle (multi-call closes, ghosting, re-engagement)

### Takeaways from Client Ascension

* **Content & Coaching:**

  * Tactical, specific, and applicable to real business

* **The Community:**

  * 140+ like-minded individuals
  * Constant motivation and collaboration
  * Exposure to world-class operators in every topic

**Brooke:** Growing up in Toronto, I didn’t have many people around me doing this. Being inside this group is next level.

**Daniel:** I’m going to drop Brooke’s links below—Twitter, YouTube. Go check him out. Thanks for coming on, brother.

**Brooke:** Of course brother. Happy to be here. Thanks for having me!

## Client Ascension Event Planning

!!! tip

    This is Video #8 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Planning the Client Ascension Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wed3AJSq_cQ) - 19 October 2022

> "Well, it was gonna happen anyway. Somebody was gonna say it—and it might as well be me."

### Opening

* Idea: record testimonial videos in front of the shop—quick, simple content generation.
* "Calling Client Ascension is the best. It’s hot. It’s simple."

### Why Build This?

* People might ask: *Why did Andre build this event?*

  * Yes, we're passionate about helping people.

    This is Video #9 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[These 3 Things Took Our Business to $220k/mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KDXT_shpwc) - 2 November 2022

### Keynote Theme: Scale to \$200K/Month

**Main Concept:**

* Understand the difference between **Force Multipliers** vs **Minor Improvements**.

#### Force Multipliers:

* Heavy needle-moving tasks
* Repeatable
* Lead to order-of-magnitude increases

#### Minor Improvements:

* Small optimizations
* Not scalable or impactful
* Example: changing button color or landing page style

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Force Multipliers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/force_multipliers.png)
  <figcaption>Force Multipliers</figcaption>
</figure>

The big arrows are force multipliers, the small ones are minor improvements.

You cannot grow your business without using force multipliers.

### The Three Force Multipliers That Took Us From \$68K to \$220K in 3 Months

#### 1. **Content: More of It**

* **Frequency**: the average number of times someone sees you per day
* The more often you're seen, the more money you make.
* Every 90 minutes, a tweet or retweet from Daniel's account goes out.

> There is no 90 minute period that elapses, my twitter account is tweeting or retweeting something.

**System Overview:**

* Scott films 2 hours daily → trimmed to 45 minutes → long-form YouTube
* Presley turns into shorts → posted across platforms → cross-promoted relentlessly

**Why Brand Awareness Matters?**

* Market awareness > ad platform metrics
* At any given time, only 1% of market is ready to buy
* When the 99% finally are, you need to *already* exist in their mind

> If you’re not the one they see when they’re ready, you nurtured someone else’s sale.

When you cold email somebody, they go to your website. They google you. They look you up on Linkedin, X, YouTube.

All of your content is ranking.

You have so MUCH on there that they piece together in their mind "there in no way this guy isn't legit. He has been doing it for so long and does so much."

I repeat. This should be their thinking.

> "there in no way this guy isn't legit. He has been doing it for so long and does so much."

Your market will sophisticate. It will happen.

Claims will go higher.

Until it's impossible to deliver an offer.

When the market sophistication gets to level 5, people will buy from YOU instead of the THING, if you have a personal brand.

- More Frequency
- More Content
- More Permanence

You are not trying to convert people now.

You're trying to permanently exist and be the default option for when they do.

Who wins?

- Someone with 300 podcast episodes, 72 Youtube videos and case studies.

- Some random person.

#### 2. **More Funnel Touchpoints**

**Simple Funnel Structure:**

* Opt-in → VSL → Calendly → Sales Call → Close

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Simple Funnel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/personal_brand/basic_funnel.png)
  <figcaption>Simple Funnel</figcaption>
</figure>

No trickery.

1) Optin gets you name - email - phone.
2) You get the phone number, you call / text em.
3) You get the email threw them on a sequence and broadcast.
4) You have a sales page with a VSL/Calendly on it.
5) You got a sales call.

**Setter Strategy:**

!!! tip

    This resulted in %30 more calls.

* Collect phone numbers
* Call 10 minutes after opt-in (twice - gives time to watch the optin)
* Call again if unanswered, follow up via text and calls over the week

They gave you their phone number.

You explicitly informed them you will be contacting them.

"But I feel like I'm annoying them."

Who cares?

**Team Separation for Coaching vs Agency:**

* Coaching/Info:

  * Setter → Closer

* Agency:

  * Cold Emailer/Cold Caller → Closer

**Efficiency Rule:**

> Never mix roles. Efficiency dies when people multitask fulfillment and sales.

**Social Proof Types:**

* **FOMO** (Fear of Missing Out): Visual experiences, livestreams, vlogs. Just FOMO'ing people into purchasing. So simple.
* **Screenshots**: Stripe results, testimonials. Stripe screenshots + description of what happened (no other data).
* **Interviews**: YouTube-style, parasocial relationship builders. Let people gradually convince themselves on their own time.
* **Lifestyle Content**: Vlogs showcasing work + lifestyle mix. Daniel's first try of this resulted in 18 calls.

Someone commented on Daniel's lifestyle content with "You guys just screw around all day?"

The answer is "no". But that does not matter, because he had this thought but what was really happening is that showed people associated that lifestyle with Client Ascension as a gateway.

Incredible 🔥

What a banger this was.

You want to limit the lifestyle stuff to %30 as you would be in business niche.

If you put too little you are leaving some force on table, if you do too much it's look like you don't know anything.

#### 3. **Hiring People**

You cannot scale by yourself.

If you are under $30k/mo, you are doing everything yourself.

**Why You’re Stuck Below $30K:**

* Working too much → no time to scale
* Scared to give up margin → never hire
* Break the cycle: Hire even if margin drops short-term

The cycle looks like this:

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Stuck Cycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/personal_brand/stuck_cycle.png)
  <figcaption>Stuck Cycle</figcaption>
</figure>

Just hire people.

What if you were to just be doing these 3 instead (which is true for Daniel).

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Daniels Part](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/personal_brand/daniels_part.png)
  <figcaption>Daniels Part</figcaption>
</figure>

People do not have obligations other than doing the precise thing in which what they are assigned.

It is functionally impossible to do all of this.

**Hiring Order:**

1. Fulfillment → Deliverables done without you

> You need to be able to sign a client and have the deliverable magically appear. This needs to happen.

2. Sales → Offload calls and outreach

The moment you get a sales guy, you will get more calls.

- There are simply more slots to pick from.

- And since you hired for fulfillment first, you have nothing else to do BUT generate calls.

> When you free up your 4 hours of deep work daily, focus shifts to call generation.

**Team Structure Examples:**

* Coaches only coach
* Sales reps only sell
* Marketing team only markets

**Malcolm Gladwell’s Rule:**

> 10,000 hours = mastery. Apply that to one lane. You’ll dominate it.

### Final Force Multiplier:

> **Wake up and win.**

Just wake up and win.

## Kyle Trouble Interview

!!! tip

    This is Video #12 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Kyle Hit $70,000/mo Inside Client Ascension with Cold Email & Twitter Ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgKwfSlTCY4) - 16 November 2022

### Opening

**Daniel:** Kyle Trouble runs a recruitment agency. Kyle, you've been in Client Ascension for about five months now. Could you share with everybody what you were making when you started and where you are now?

**Kyle:** Thanks for having me on, first and foremost. When I joined Client Ascension, I was floating somewhere around $17K to $20K/month in recurring revenue. It's a placement agency, so we’re basically paying the candidates every month. Now, with one-time fees from last month, recurring revenue is up around mid-50s, and we should hit around $60K in the coming days. With how the initial starting fee and offer is now dialed in, I think this month we’ll be close to $70K.

**Daniel:** That’s so dope. No signs of stopping either.

**Kyle:** None at all. Growth’s fast. Based on our last one-on-one, it feels pretty inevitable we’ll hit $100K–$150K within the next four months.

**Daniel:** Could you share—without giving away too much sauce—how you're getting clients?

**Kyle:** I can share most of it. It's a mix of:

* Word of mouth and referrals
* Twitter ads – running at a 5–6x ROAS
* Cold email (with a VSL made by Steven that’s converting well)
* A friend running ads on another platform (which I’ll keep secret for now)

**Daniel:** People in Client Ascension might be the only humans getting positive ROAS on Twitter ads.

**Kyle:** It's crazy. Twitter ads are cheap and targeted.

**Daniel:** Unlike Facebook lead forms, you get actual quality prospects who know why they’re on the call. Plus, it’s socially integrated. People see your content, then your ad, and the domino effect kicks in. Tracking’s still abysmal though.

### Breaking Points

**Daniel:** Were there any breaking points or mindset shifts that made a big difference?

**Kyle:** Yeah. Back in college I sold Bose headphones, was the top associate in California. Thought I could bring the same sales energy here—but Bose had brand recognition. I was just an order taker. Once I realized that difference, I stopped treating these like warm sales.

Then I thought—why not make everything warmer?

* Increased ad spend
* Added a strong VSL
* Daily email follow-ups

Now, prospects show up warm. Sales calls are easier.

I'm just sitting there waiting for an objection. I hired Steven to make the VSL.

It went live Oct 25, and already paid for itself by Nov 10.

**Daniel:** [VSL's make everything order of magnitude better](https://youtu.be/XgKwfSlTCY4?t=381).

### Next Steps

**Daniel:** Where do you want to take this? Build it to $500K/month or sell it?

**Kyle:** I lived in Ukraine for five years. My wife and daughter are Ukrainian. I care about helping good people get good jobs—clients and candidates. But both sides can be fickle.

I don’t want to do this forever. I don’t have an exit plan yet, but I’m onboarding three team members next week

Just trying to:

* Step on the gas
* Exit the day-to-day
* Maybe sell it or stay on as a consultant

### Advice for B2B Owners Considering Client Ascension

**Daniel:** If someone’s running a B2B business—agency, consultant, freelancer—and thinking about joining, what would you say?

**Kyle:** You’ll learn the macro and the micro:

**Macro:**

* Try everything
* Go all-in
* Ramp up cold emails (I’m doing 400/day now)
* When momentum hits, pour fuel on it

**Micro:**

* Sales nuances
* Cold email refinement
* Quick, tactical help from experts (10-minute calls that just solve the problem)

The network effect is massive.

Being surrounded by people who are actually doing it is invaluable.

### Final Notes

If you’re interested in hiring VAs, project managers, CTOs, CMOs, devs, or automation engineers—Kyle’s your guy.

Thanks for coming on, Kyle!

## David Mendes Interview

!!! tip

    This is Video #13 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[From Sales Rep to Making $45,000/mo inside Client Ascension (Creating a High Ticket B2B Offer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRS-qlwoCQI) - 18 November 2022

### Introduction

David Mendez is in Client Ascension and we're going to talk about what he does and try to give you some value here.

David, tell us what you do and about how much you're making.

**David:** "Yes sir. What I basically do is launch high-ticket coaching programs for people — like a done-for-you service. Right now, I'd say I'm making around $40K to $50K a month. My offer structure is a little complex because I have a performance-based type of setup.

Before this, I was a sales rep selling **coaching offers** with some of the largest companies in our space. I was doing $15K to $20K a month in commissions, and it was around this time I joined Client Ascension because I wanted to do my own thing.

I reached out to Daniel and insisted that he help me out. We brainstormed offer ideas and eventually landed on something that worked. I signed my first client about a month after going public and started making good money quickly."

!!!  tip

    He got good what he is doing.

### From Sales Rep to Offer Owner

**Daniel:** "You're the perfect example of someone who used **job experience** to create an offer. You were a sales guy, then translated that **knowledge** into owning your own offer — which is the step many people miss if they want to really scale.

> You need to own the offer!

You did it by choosing performance-based pricing because you're confident you'll drive big money. That's the move when you're good."

I repeat here.

> That's the move when you're good. DO this if you ARE GOOD.

**David:** "Exactly. I always believed that's the best way to start a business — by working inside someone else's and learning in the trenches. Once you've earned your stripes, you synthesize that experience into something where you have an unfair advantage."

### The Launch Process

**Daniel:** "So tell me about your process. How do you launch coaching programs?"

**David:** "Gladly. My process is based on a few principles:

0. **Do you actually have an expertise?**: I partner only with people who have real expertise. I don’t want to work with people who don’t know what they’re talking about.

1. **Find Out What People Want**: Either you create it or arbitrage it. After you find this information, you can meet the demand, making this out of thin air.

2. **Leverage Existing Audiences**: I prefer partners who already have some kind of social presence. Because of that, their followers are already pre-interested. That gives us an asset to launch with.

3. **Direct Market Feedback**: We talk directly to their audience. Not doing what everyone else is doing (which is a good way if you are an absolute beginner). We run consults, ask discovery questions, and figure out what they really want. Run discovery calls with giving some free value upfront. This puts us way ahead of people who are just guessing.

4. **Build Launch Assets**: These are core content pieces that accelerate the buyer journey. Instead of weeks of exposure, we build content that compresses that into one sitting.

Examples:

   * Long-form sales letter (Basically free sauce as a huge content. With a note in the end, you can do this yourself or we can work together.)

> It's not [about the information](https://youtu.be/BRS-qlwoCQI?t=712). The information already exists. They can literally take it if they want. But most people don't because we know that it's way more efficient to do it with somebody else who has already done it.

> "You can do it yourself or you can do it with us".

> This is your opt-in which you use your email list.

   * Power offer

> This is who is for. This is exactly who we are going to go through. This is the goal. Here is some scarcity and here is some urgency. If you are interested book a call.

   * VSLs (case studies)

> Once you get your first big round of customers. You build a case study VSL. "This is how this person achieved this"

   * Free courses or YouTube playlists

> Make content. Just exist.

We put these assets on repeat. We auto-retweet them, repost them, and let them do the selling.

This just accelerates the conversion window for each customer.

### Execution with Speed

**David:** "This system only works if you know what the market wants. Once we have that data, we structure everything — the offer, the funnel, the content — around it. The result: predictable conversion.

And Client Ascension helped me launch this from nothing. Daniel and I built the offer together from scratch. The clarity and execution plan they gave me helped me move fast.

> Most valuable thing was to having access to someone who has done these. The synthesis and the positioning of the offer.

I just needed someone who had done it before to bounce ideas off of and then go execute. That back-and-forth was extremely valuable."

> Having specific executables on a specific timeline.

> [If I could get this massive case study, everything else just happens inevitably.](https://youtu.be/BRS-qlwoCQI?t=1138)

Daniel will [force you to move](https://youtu.be/BRS-qlwoCQI?t=1166).

### Client Ascension's Impact

**David:** "Client Ascension gave me clarity and accountability. I’m a doer, so when they gave me action steps, I executed. Daniel checked in and held me accountable. If something wasn’t done, he called me out."

That kind of pressure and clarity is what gets results.

And it’s not just about content or calls — being around high-level people in the community creates network effect leverage.

### Extending Client Lifetime Value

**Daniel:** "You helped people scale. You should build sales teams for them too."

That's the logical next step. Here's how it works:

1. I start by taking sales calls myself and closing.
2. I record those calls and use them to create a repeatable process.
3. I onboard a closer and go back-to-back with them on calls.
4. Once they’re onboarded, I step back.

You can't scale a business unless you transfer your skill into systems and people.

I build the sales system from my experience and then use it to train others.

!!! tip

    You get your sales guys after you have to have a good opportunity vehicle. If you don't have this they will churn.

    You want them to stay for the long run.

    They will make more money and you too.

    As soon as the opportunity vehicle is good enough, go.

### Final Thoughts

**David:** "If someone is stuck at $5K to $10K/month trying to scale, they’re probably in a commoditized market doing what everyone else is doing. You need to be in a room with people ahead of the curve.

Client Ascension is that room. This is where new ideas generated. Where trends start.

Join early, gain asymmetric returns, and position yourself as the go-to person in your niche."

**Daniel:** "Thanks, David. I'm going to leave links to all of David’s stuff in the description if anyone wants to connect with him or work with him. Thanks, brother."

"Absolutely. Thank you."

## Scott Millard Interview

!!! tip

    This is Video #14 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Scott Hit $33,000/mo inside Client Ascension (Video Marketing Agency & Getting Clients)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHpLrRgBGP0) - 21 November 2022

### Introduction and First Impressions

Scott Millard joins the conversation from Tampa and talks about how Client Ascension has evolved into a strong, tight-knit community. What began as online collaboration has grown into real-life friendships, further enhanced by multiple in-person meetups.

Scott highlights the camaraderie and support within the Slack channels and wind channels, explaining how important it is to have peers who are walking a similar path.

Prior to joining, he felt alone in his entrepreneurial journey, but the group changed that.

### Scott's Background and Starting Point

At the end of the previous year, Scott was working a low-paying job at a social media startup, making just $3K/month.

Feeling undervalued and stuck, he quit and spent two months earning no income.

Eventually, he began selling videos online, even though he didn’t fully understand the concept of an "offer" at the time.

He joined Twitter, found Client Ascension, and made $5K/month, which was the minimum requirement to join the program.

He recalls living in his childhood bedroom with no money and describes those days as being in **the trenches**.

### Growth After Joining Client Ascension

After joining Client Ascension, Scott experienced a 10x increase in his monthly income within six months.

He went from not knowing what a cold email or sales offer was to learning how to construct a high-ROI offer, close sales calls, and streamline fulfillment.

One notable milestone was hiring his first full-time employee, whom he now pays the same salary he used to earn himself.

He credits the structured support of Client Ascension, including SOP guidance from coaches like Andre, as instrumental in navigating this transition.

> You can use what people are experiencing and using (inside Client Ascension) as the solutions of their problems.

### Systematic Growth and Business Clarity

Scott recalls a 1-on-1 conversation with Daniel where he was "bullied" into hiring his first employee because he was working too much and not spending time growing the business.

Once he made the hire, time was freed up to focus on higher-leverage activities.

This decision made scaling to $50K/month realistic, and Scott began understanding the mechanics behind sustainable business growth.

### From Living at Home to Location Freedom

Scott reflects on the emotional toll of moving back in with his parents and how that affected his confidence.

Now, he has location freedom, can provide for his family, and experiences the empowering feeling of being able to generate income independently.

Client Ascension helped give him direction, clarity, and a tactical blueprint to scale his business.

He learned how to execute cold emails, run Twitter ads, and automate parts of his business, all within a short time.

> You don't run out of things to do.

### Momentum and Consistent Progression

He outlines his monthly income progression: 3K, 5K, 7K, 10K, 15K, 20K, 25K, and most recently 33K.

What once felt impossible now seems inevitable.

The concept of "price floors" in revenue and gradually raising those floors each month has proven to be highly effective.

He notes that scaling is clean and systematic inside Client Ascension, and it ensures the business remains stable and service quality isn’t sacrificed.

> Daniel says, it's just clean scaling.

### Unique Value of Client Ascension

Scott compares Client Ascension to other communities and explains why it stands out:

* Individualized guidance and 1-on-1 coaching
* Clear timelines, tasks, and deliverables
* Systems to optimize acquisition and fulfillment
* Tactical support for cold email, Twitter ads, LinkedIn, and more

He emphasizes how rare it is to find a group of people who are all actually succeeding and pushing each other to do better.

### Access to High-Level Mentorship

Scott mentions learning from people inside the program who are making $100K+ and even $200K+ per month.

He particularly references Oliver, who runs a large-scale cold email operation.

These interactions provide a unique opportunity for peer learning and real-world insights.

### Projected Growth and New Offers

In the next six months, Scott is aiming to consistently hit $50K/month and achieve $500K in annual revenue.

He is actively working on a new high-ticket offer that can be sold both on the front-end and to existing clients.

Scott explains how Client Ascension helped him raise his prices, identify better prospects, and develop higher-margin offers.

!!! example

    How do people actually get to 50k/mo - 100k/mo - 200k/mo ?

    Scott says they have more employees, more cold email domains and more recurrring clients.

    Daniel says, they just have more time implementing the same thing you have been implementing.

Selling to bigger businesses has become easier and more profitable.

> Acquire more customers, make more money on existing customers.

### Closing Thoughts and Final Endorsement

Scott reiterates that Client Ascension made his current success possible.

He highlights the community, the structured support, and the accountability systems in place.

Daniel wraps up by emphasizing the integrity of the program and the focus on real results over vanity metrics.

> Stop working with people who do not have the money.

Scott's links and the Client Ascension opt-in page are provided for those interested in learning more or joining the community.

!!! tip

    Daniel says,

    You can sell to larger businesses.

    Stop talking to small businesses. Charge more money and only work with them.

[$25M Agency Owner Throws Birthday Banger in London (We Went)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba-xdx6YNoc) - 7 December 2022

Daniel spills some sauce in this video.

### YouTube Lead Gen and SOP

> So it's like 500 to 1500 passive views a day on YouTube. We've signed two clients just from YouTube exclusively so far and there's like a ton of leads that come in just from YouTube.

Now, so it is **standard operating procedure** now by executive order: everybody in Client Ascension has to make YouTube videos because it's so stupidly easy.

The system is so simple: you come up with the title, make a video specifically to rank for a search term, then SEO optimize it and release it. All of your Twitter content and LinkedIn content stem as output from the YouTube video.

So I'm just going to very simply lay it out: how to find the titles, how to SEO optimize, and then how to translate into the other content.

Then put appointment setters and people messaging you, and get them on meetings. Bam, you make a ton of money.

It's that simple. 

If you want to see how that works, go to clientascension.com.

### Client Ascension Effectiveness

We get like 300 to 500 unique people to clientascension.com basically every day. 100% do that.

It works so well. That’s one of those things where you see it and it sounds so simple. Then you do it and you’re like, holy s***, that works so well.

You have to do it.

Exert s*** into the world.

I don't know what Daniel is referring here, but it's made in [Hypefury](https://hypefury.com/).

### Four Seasons and Birthday

How to make Social proof as video?

Opening line: 

> First question literally, "Hey Kyle you have been with client ascension for five months now, can you share with everybody what you started before Client Ascension at and then where you are now?"

He's going to give a specific time period and a specific increase.

So now that it hits two of those, it's **speed** and **certainty**.

It's "I did it this time and it did happen." Yes.

Then you have a s*** ton of those.

So it's just multiple replications of **speed** and **certainty**.

As many as you can. That's it.

Then the rest of it is you just spitting bars with them like it's a podcast.

Now what's happening is they kind of want to like see if they can get something out of you, and then you drop some snippets of like really easy, useful s***.

The audience hear 6-7-8 things. It gets so overwhelming.

They are going to be like ***"Alright I had enough I'm booking a call!"***

It takes 25-30 mins.

Rest of the video is just vibes.

## Michael Interview

!!! tip

    This is Video #20 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Michael Hit $80k/mo in Client Ascension (And How to Get Clients & Systematize Your Business)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=genAUzah4Yo) - 15 December 2022

### Introduction

**Daniel**: What's up everybody! I got Michael here. Michael is a G and he is inside Client Ascension.

**Daniel**: Michael, could you let everyone know what you’re selling, what your business is, where you came in for Client Ascension, and where you are now?

**Michael**: Yeah, what we do through Client Ascension is run an Amazon FBA coaching program. I’m a former CPA corporate accountant who started selling on Amazon, built a private label brand via Amazon, and used that to quit my 9-to-5 job. Then I linked up with my guy Ryan (aka the FBA investor) and we started mentoring people.

We had courses and that led to our current program inside Client Ascension — the Amazon Accelerator 2.0 Program. We take students from all walks of life, most start at zero, some have current Amazon or ecommerce businesses but don’t know what’s going on. We guide them through each step: finding products, sourcing, designing high-converting listings, all the way to scaling a brand. Some do six figures within our 12-month program.

Before Client Ascension, we were doing a lot of one-on-one work, didn’t really have a structured offer or program, just dudes on Twitter sharing success.

People would ask us for mentorship and, like any entrepreneur, the answer was yes.

But since then, we’ve refined the program and our results — and business — have improved dramatically.

### Results Since Joining

**Daniel**: Yeah, you showed me some of your client results, and they were really good. That’s why I had confidence in you guys. When you joined, it was a one-on-one thing, and switching to group with structure made a big difference.

**Michael**: Absolutely. One doesn’t work without the other. More students building businesses = a better business for us.

**Daniel**: Are you comfortable sharing revenue growth?

**Michael**: Sure. We came to you in June, doing around $20–25K/month. We wanted to do group coaching and still offer one-on-one — our call links are basically always available, similar to what you do.

In October, we had our best month — over $80K. November came back to about $65K.

Now in December, we’re aiming for $100K. So we’re growing fast, and refining systems to maintain that hands-on, white-glove approach.

### Operational Upgrades & Execution

**Michael**: Operationally, Client Ascension has been huge. We always had the information, but we were scattered. Solopreneurs piecing things together inefficiently. Now we sell with conviction because we know onboarding is smooth, people are guided through the system, they book calls, and within months they’re launching products. You helped us tighten that up.

**Daniel**: Yeah, most people get stuck between $20–30K/month. It’s hard to scale without systems. I like working with you because you always show up to calls with a specific problem, I give you a solution, and then it gets done. Over and over.

**Michael**: We just hired a closer, so we’re no longer doing our own sales calls. That freed us up for high-quality content and running the program. Next is building a robust sales team. Our lead flow is great, and we know the program works. We just needed help with structure and growth.

### Growth Systems & Execution Style

**Daniel**: I remember pulling up a Google Doc and laying out a blueprint: "Do this, this, this…" You guys executed so fast. The next project is probably more closers and a Setter. We’re building systems around that — access to Setters, ops people, etc.

**Michael**: Yeah, it’s been wild how quick things moved. First 60–90 days in Client Ascension we doubled. Our community and Top Line grew fast. And you’re right — your system works the same for agencies, coaches, or B2B companies. You just need to execute it.

Here are the exact sentences.

> Our content slaps when we have time. It's just that iteration. If we have the time and the systems, it's just going to grow. We'll get more leverage, we'll reach a lot more people for each exertion of effort.

**Daniel**: It’s taken me 4.5 years to figure this out. But now someone like you can come in, follow it for 2–3 months, and boom — big results.

**Michael**: Exactly. Our target market is anyone who hates their 9–5, and it’s a wide net. We tell people: just trust the system and execute. It’s the same thing over and over. You just need clarity and guidance.

### Leverage & Content Strategy

**Daniel**: You probably have students like you — solve one block, move to the next. When you understand how a system works, you can scale massively. Going from $20K to $80K/month in six months is wild. Next step: $250K/month.

**Michael**: Yeah, and it’s about consistency and content. We’re expanding from Twitter to YouTube (Amazon FBA University), Instagram, email list. Message resonates, content lands — it’s all about iteration and reach. Systems let you scale reach.

**Daniel**: Each exertion becomes higher leverage. Especially with YouTube. Just dropped seven new tutorials in the announcements channel.

**Michael**: I’ll check those out. When you start a business, you work like crazy and get nothing. But results compound. Early struggle creates later leverage. I think a beginner with no clients needs 300–500 hours to get their first. But then results start compounding fast.

**Daniel**: Yeah. Marketing is like sets in the gym. A set is a month: 4 YouTube videos, 10 Twitter threads, 20 LinkedIn posts, 500 DMs, 4,000 emails. You want to grow? Add volume, hire help, and increase the set. It’s inevitable — results come if you keep lifting.

**Michael**: Absolutely. Guidance turns subconscious action into momentum. Dopamine aligns with real progress. Execution becomes intuitive.

**Daniel**: Yeah. Thanks for coming on, brother. I’ll leave your YouTube, Twitter, and links in the description.

**Michael**: Appreciate you. To anyone out there — join Client Ascension. Learn from the best. Speed is real. Price goes up soon, so jump in before the new year.

## Sam Heedy Interview

    This is Video #21 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Sam Built a $55k/mo Tik Tok & Short Form Content Agency (Client Ascension Case Study)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG-0lNq6QTE) - 21 December 2022


**Daniel:** First, Sam — Lord Commander of TikTok organic marketing and all things getting results for clients — how are we doing, good sir?

**Sam:** I'm very good, thank you very much for having me.

**Daniel:** Could you share with everybody what your business is and what revenue level you're at right now so they get context for this conversation?

**Sam:** Perfect. I run an organic TikTok marketing agency specifically for realtors, personal brands, and restaurants. We currently have $55,000 in monthly recurring revenue, and we only work with serious people.

**Daniel:** You just signed a big deal too. Can you share what that deal looked like?

**Sam:** Yep. I signed a $9,500/month client for six months. It’s a huge win because I almost touched five figures per month from a single client. Previously, I had a good service but was targeting the wrong people. I was also hesitant to charge more because the results weren’t what I wanted. Over time, as we scaled and the results became undeniable, it justified the investment. Joining Client Ascension helped me systemize everything.

**Sam:** Before that, I was doing all the work myself — a huge struggle. My time is better spent creating content. I'm currently in Dubai, and my team is running fulfillment while I’m here. That was my main 2022 goal: systemize and work only with aligned, high-level clients.

**Daniel:** I remember you were working 12-hour days. We paused acquisition to operationalize. I know Andre helped a lot.

**Sam:** Yes, just one call with Andre changed everything. It’s broken down in a way that’s easy to execute. Most agency owners get stuck on fulfillment — once you scale, maintaining quality is hard. The operation-side unlocks your ability to focus on your core zone of genius — content creation and strategy.

**Daniel:** So now you're in Dubai, your business runs itself, clients are served, and you're not handcuffed to a job. That's the point — to build a system and be the CEO. And you have premium leads ready to convert.

**Sam:** Yes, and they’re all high-level. We’re selling $9k+/month retainers with systematized delivery. That’s the goal.

**Daniel:** You’re one of the best in the short-form content agency space. Can you talk about how you consistently get results?

**Sam:** The key is understanding what your audience wants. Don’t just post content — ask them what they want to see. Who sees it matters more than view count. We've driven 9M+ organic views with no paid ads and added 30% sales to our clients' businesses.

Our system is called NUIC: New, Unique, Interesting, Controversial. Content that fits this and is posted correctly will go viral.

**Sam:** You need to stand for something. Say things that matter. All of my clients are like me — unafraid to take a stance. Example: in Singapore, a client got 180k views on one video — that’s like 1M+ in the U.S. due to audience size. The system, hooks, editing — we’ve got it down.

**Daniel:** That **obsession with mastery** is exactly why you’re successful. Everyone follows the same line — get clients, get results, build systems, hire people. Without systematizing, no matter how many leads you have, you won’t scale.

**Sam:** Finding great editors was hard — took months. But now the system works. Team members execute daily. I focus on lead generation and closing. That’s the CEO role.

**Daniel:** Talk about the difference between a $3k client and a $9k client.

**Sam:** It’s night and day. **I hate working with unambitious people**. If I have to convince you TikTok is useful, you’re not my client. Higher-paying clients are proactive, give feedback, and help us improve. Lower-tier clients take time away from high-value clients. I want to build something great — not run a charity. I also bought my parents a car and flew to Dubai without worrying about the cost. That’s the result of systems and mentorship.

**Sam:** I now reinvest heavily in marketing. That’s key. If you're afraid to invest in growth, you're not going to last. As CEO, your job is to reinvest and stay out of the weeds. I’ve learned that the hard way.

**Daniel:** I was talking with someone yesterday — that exact sentence you said, “I booked a flight and didn’t think about it,” is the goal. You want to have that freedom. But people forget that it takes intense, extended effort to get there.

**Sam:** Higher-paying clients are just better. They don’t manufacture drama. If 9k is easy for them, they’re likely also execution-driven. It’s a self-filtering system. **Better clients, better results**.

**Sam:** When I joined Client Ascension, I kept my mouth shut and just did what you told me. If you're not making the money you want, lower your ego. Stop pretending you know everything. Find people who’ve done what you want to do and follow them. That’s what I did.

**Sam:** I specialize in content. So I found mentors for operations and systems. If you want to scale, that’s essential. You can’t do it alone. I fully recommend Client Ascension — it’s the best support system out there. And if you don’t have the money to join, make more. That’s what I did.

**Daniel:** Appreciate you brother. We’ll put Sam’s links in the description. See you inside Client Ascension.

**Daniel:** What’s up everybody! I’ve got top G Colin over here—he runs a Google Ads agency. Colin, can you introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your business?

**Colin:** Yeah, so I’m Colin Schmelbeck. I run a Google Ads agency primarily for e-commerce stores. Recently, I’ve repositioned more toward training and consulting in-house brands. That shift is something *Client Ascension* really helped me with over the past 4–5 months.

### 🤝 The In-House Client Problem & Solution

**Daniel:** I remember you saying the classic agency problem: clients do well, then say, “We’re taking this in-house.”

**Colin:** Always. Now, I solve that by *selling a consulting program* to help train the in-house hire they’re about to bring on.

* Keeps them in the ecosystem
* If their hire underdelivers, they come back anyway
* I’ve had **3–4 clients return within a quarter**

### 👥 Hiring & Scaling the Team

**Colin:**

* Hired a full-time Google Ads specialist
* Slowly hiring for the consulting side
* Used to use 20 Zaps—now we’re running 20,000 Zapier credits/month
* Still learning to systemize as I go

### 💡 From Stuck at $30K to $100K+/Month

**Colin:**

* Stuck around \$30K/month through most of 2021
* Left my Google Ads job at Solutions 8
* Went all in → *stayed consistent*
* Now hitting $100K/month

### ⏳ Less Fulfillment, More Strategic Thinking

**Colin:**

* Used to work 12+ hour days
* Now: 3–4 hours/day max on service delivery
* Spend the rest of my time:

* You don't need:

  * Expensive ads
  * Outside lead gen agencies

### 💸 Why Hiring Helps, Not Hurts

**Daniel:** Most agency owners hesitate to hire because they want to “protect margins,” even when it's hurting their growth.

**Colin:**

* Been there
* Pay my guy **$5K/month**
* He brings **$15–20K back**
* Hiring lets me *think* and *build* instead of doing everything

### 👶 Fatherhood & Redefining Productivity

**Colin:**

* As a dad now, I *can’t* work 12 hours anymore
* By 8PM, I’m done
* Had to learn to delegate and operate differently

### 🧠 Mastery: Know Who You Serve & Charge More

**Daniel:** At some point, you figure out:

* What *kind* of business you get the best results for
* Their exact needs
* And when they show up, you *close them easily*

**Colin:**

* I started identifying the *specific* clients I help best
* Those are the ones I now target and charge more confidently

### 💬 Consulting = Scalable, High-Leverage

**Colin:**

* 20 booked calls → I really want to work with **1 or 2**
* The rest:

  * Some can’t afford it
  * Others just want to be shown how → **Consulting offer**

### The Growth Path: Everyone Follows It

**Daniel:** Every business eventually follows the same path:

1. Raise your prices
2. Reduce client count
3. Offer consulting for the ones who don’t fit
4. Scale with content + systems

### Colin’s Advice to New Joiners

**Colin:**

> "Shorten the time from **thinking → action**. Just do the thing. Execution speed is everything."

### 🧰 Fundamentals Beat Hacks

**Daniel:**

* Don’t focus on gimmicks (e.g. “send 200 cold emails” then complain)

* Fix your:

  * Landing page
  * Offer
  * Sales system
  * Follow-ups

* *Then* turn on traffic

**Colin:**

> "I joined at $40–50K/month and still hadn’t set up a CRM or positioning properly. Once I did, things moved fast."

### 🎯 2023 Goals

**Colin:**

* Goal: **$2M/year**
* 70–80% from **consulting**
* Keep “done-for-you” only for brands I love
* Focus: YouTube, Twitter, and ripping out content

**Colin:**

> "Thanks again! Appreciate *Client Ascension*. It’s awesome."

## Dillon Interview

    This is Video #26 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Dillon Made a $42k/mo Lead Generation Marketing Agency in 5 Months (Client Ascension Case Study)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhjg9QLvcI) - 12 January 2023

Sure! Here's the formatted transcript with section headlines and **no timestamps**:

### 1. Introduction

**Daniel (Host):** Yo what's up everybody, I got Dylan Andrews here. Dylan is a very good friend of mine now. Brother, could you just introduce yourself and let everybody know what you do?

**Dylan:** Yeah, so I started an agency five months ago from zero. We help financial professionals—anyone in the financial space—generate leads through email. That’s it. We do it for ourselves and for them.

### 2. The Backstory

**Daniel:** And we’ve been friends on Twitter for a while. Normally in Client Ascension we don’t work with people who are at $0/month, because they often can’t fulfill the service. But you had some prior experience?

**Dylan:** Yeah, I’ve been around since Cold Email Mastery. I used to run emails for people as a side hustle. Sold a company last year, and then I was slowly going broke. This was the quickest way to start making money again.

**Daniel:**  So five months ago, you hit reset. What are you at now—$30K/month?

**Dylan:** Actually around $40K–$50K. We have 15 clients. We scaled up quickly after figuring out fulfillment.

### 3. Hitting the Fulfillment Wall

**Daniel:** Last time we spoke, you were dealing with fulfillment burnout.

**Dylan:** Exactly. We ripped it up fast, then hit the wall. I wanted to burn the whole thing down. Talked to Andre, fixed backend systems, hired a VA, built a Trello board. Now we're at 15 clients, running smoothly.

**Daniel:** $10–20K/month is where founders often die without systems.

**Dylan:** Even with a partner, it’s heavy. But once I got a system in place, it wasn’t that hard. Just had to talk to someone doing it.

### 4. Scaling Requires Systems

**Daniel:** Client Ascension has 200+ clients. Without systems, you’re dead. Our ops involve 200+ Zapier automations and 21 people.

**Dylan:** Yeah, the $20–30K/month range is the danger zone. You either fall back or explode past it depending on your systems.

**Daniel:** Exactly. You build a productized agency or go the growth partner route with high-touch clients and profit shares.

**Dylan:** Most businesses aren’t even making money. You realize that fast once you start doing outreach. Even VC-funded ones are broke or pre-revenue.

### 5. Why Most Clients Fail (It’s Not You)

**Daniel:** SMMA YouTubers blame themselves for client churn, but they’re working with terrible businesses. You can’t get results for broke people.

**Dylan:** Exactly. People assume “business” = money. But local businesses often make nothing. Go meet the owner—it’s not what you expect.

**Daniel:**  Never sell DFY services to anyone making under $20K/month profit. You’ll lose.

### 6. Proper Filtering and Lead Quality

**Dylan:** We filter for companies with 10+ employees or $1M+ in revenue. Lean consultants sometimes crush it too, so we flex depending on niche.

**Daniel:** I told Nick Palazz this exact thing. He wasn’t bad at sales—he was pitching broke people. Switched the list, started closing.

**Dylan:** Yeah, you don’t want to be “the guy who saves the business.” That’s not your job.

### 7. Selling to Buyers Who Have Money

**Daniel:** Exactly. You want clients where $5K/month is insignificant. They think long-term and understand how value compounds.

**Dylan:** And they barely contact you! The ones who pay the most are chill and quiet.

**Daniel:** It’s always the case. High payers = best clients. They stay longer, complain less, and get better results.

### 8. Charge High or Charge Low — Nothing in Between

**Daniel:** There are only two ways to make a lot of money: be the cheapest, or be the most expensive. The middle is death.

**Daniel:** You’re either McDonald’s or a Prime Steakhouse. Middle-class pricing doesn’t work—there’s no market.

**Dylan:** Some people have millions liquid. You’re not selling to your broke cousin.

**Daniel:** Facts. High earners will pay $10K/month for qualified leads. They’re used to spending to grow.

### 9. The Long Game and Cold Email Reality

**Dylan:** Cold email follow-ups are where 70–80% of conversions come from. **Takes months**.

**Daniel:** Yes! Prospects are busy. They are running a business. The real money comes in after 30–60 days.

### 10. Division of Roles

**Daniel:** So where do you lean—marketing, sales, or fulfillment?

**Dylan:** Marketing all day. I live for getting leads. Sales is my partner’s thing. Ops is forced labor, lol.

### 11. Accepting the Suck

**Daniel:** Even coaching, SaaS, or info products have ops. You don’t escape it.

**Dylan:** It’s just part of the game. You either embrace the suck or stay small.

**Daniel:** This is why we get paid. Otherwise, it’d be too easy.

### 12. Work Hours and Focus

**Dylan:** I could survive on 4–5 hours/day, but I spend the rest thinking about growth. I choose to push.

### 13. Final Words

**Daniel:** Respect. Alright, we’re at 43 minutes. Everyone who wants to connect with Dylan—his Twitter, YouTube, and more are in the description. He’s hilarious and sharp. Go follow him.

**Dylan:** Thanks for having me, man.

## Chandler Interview

!!! tip

    This is Video #27 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Chandler Hit $3,500,000 With His SMB Inside Client Ascension (B2B Lead Gen + Client Acquisition)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLtC6IiGUjI) - 25 January 2023

### 1. Introduction

**Daniel:** Yo what's up everybody, I got Chandler here. Chandler is a good friend now and obviously inside Client Ascension. He's here to share his experience and talk business.

**Chandler:** I run a green energy contractor business for commercial real estate. We handle energy efficiency projects like LED lighting, plumbing, EV charging stations, and solar. We're essentially a project management and sales platform—we sub out all labor. That allowed us to do projects in Washington and New York, and everywhere in between.

### 2. From $900K to $3.5M: The Power of Client Ascension

I joined Client Ascension in early 2022. My business did $900K in 2021, and by the end of 2022, we hit just under $3.5M. That growth was largely due to what I learned in Client Ascension—especially the lead gen systems. While many members turn these lessons into agencies, I applied it to my SMB. We’re now a cold email machine.

A lot of people complain about saturation in B2B outreach, but we operate in commercial real estate—a space where business development still means spending $25K on a trade show booth and hoping someone walks by. Instead, I’m scraping emails, sending sequences, and using the sales script and structure from Connor to close deals.

### 3. Bridging Digital and Traditional Business Models

**Daniel:** It’s wild how you merged traditional SMB operations with digital systems. You’re arbitraging labor in a modern way. You’re like the hybrid between old-school contracting and SaaS playbooks.

**Chandler:** Exactly. We sit in a physical office—it’s our startup garage. But our backend is all digital. Many businesses doing $5M or more are still on paper. We bought this business in 2021 and layered on new-age systems. That’s where the magic is—taking outdated businesses and supercharging them.

### 4. Simple Repeatable Business Development System

I posted a breakdown of our lead gen system—it’s very simple.

It’s just a repeatable business process.

And because it’s so trainable, we can hand it off to SDRs or BDRs. That’s what makes it scalable.

Right now, our only bottleneck is fulfillment—supply chain, labor shortages, and price changes. That’s the nature of real-world businesses. But it's worth it.

### 5. High-Ticket Sales Are Easier

**Daniel:** Isn’t it so much easier to scale when what you sell is expensive?

**Chandler:** 100%. We close five- to six-figure contracts with cold email. Some people are trying to make $100K/month selling $300 retainers. I'd rather close one $100K deal.

The simplicity of our system is what shocks other SMB owners.

They ask how we went from $900K to $3.5M. I say, "Cold email." They’re floored.

### 6. Golf, Lifestyle, and Building an Entity

**Daniel:** You and Dylan just made a golf video—you’re in that place now where you’ve built a cash-flowing machine and can enjoy the benefits.

**Chandler:** Yeah, it's not fully automated, but close. Once you hit that $3M/year mark with solid margins, life changes. It’s a turning point.

### 7. Breaking Ops on Purpose

We recently made our first sales hire. It gave me back 20 hours/week. This was a turnaround deal—I bought like seven jobs in one.

But now I know exactly who to hire.

My business philosophy is: **grow demand until operations break, then fix ops, then break them again.**

That’s how we scale. Oscillating between breaking and fixing is how we keep leveling up.

### 8. To Sell or Not to Sell?

**Daniel:** Would you ever sell your business?

**Chandler:** Maybe. But selling now gets me what—$6–7M? Then I’d need to redeploy that capital anyway.

Plus, at 27, $6M doesn’t mean I can retire. I’d probably just use it to buy a bigger business and run the same playbook.

SMBs trade at 3–5x SDE, so often you’re looking at a ~1x revenue multiple. If I sell, it’s to roll into a bigger play.

### 9. Rollups, Refinancing, and Playing the Long Game

There’s also the roll-up game—buying similar businesses and combining them. 

That’s how some people exit for $100M+.

A guy I know in Tampa started a cleaning business and rolled up others—exited for $250M and is doing it again.

If you don’t sell, refinance.

That’s the real estate playbook: refinance instead of selling, get cash out, and keep the asset.

Same idea here—refi the business, pull tax-free capital.

### 10. Compounding Knowledge and the Power of Cold Email

**Daniel:** The longer you hold the asset, the more your competencies compound. What’s 3.5M today could be $50M in five years.

Cold email is even compounding—you send follow-ups, and someone replies months later.

Everything stacks over time.

**Chandler:** Totally. The whole game is compounding: skills, relationships, systems. You sell only if you believe the party’s over.

### 11. Final Words

**Daniel:** Dude, thank you for coming on. $900K to $3.5M is insane. Just make sure you do $6M–$7M next year.

**Chandler:** That’s what we’re forecasting.

**Daniel:** I’ll drop Chandler’s links below. Go follow him. And if you’re not in Client Ascension yet... what are you doing? It works.

This was one of the best videos.

## Connor Interview

!!! tip

    This is Video #30 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Building a $20k/mo HubSpot Consulting Agency in 180 Days (Marketing Agency, Client Ascension)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnU-NqR2DT4) - 21 February 2023

Here’s your clean, structured version of the transcript — properly formatted using `###` headings, **no timestamps**, and with **Daniel as the host**:

### From Zero to \$20K/Month in Six Months – Meet Connor

**Daniel:** What's up everybody — I’ve got Connor here. Connor, how you doing?

**Connor:** I'm excellent, how are you?

**Daniel:** Good! So, you're inside Client Ascension. Could you walk everyone through where you started before joining, and where you are now?

**Connor:** Yeah, absolutely. I effectively started at zero. I had been doing some consulting, but I reset everything and decided to consolidate into one offer: HubSpot marketing and sales operations. I got my first client at $7K/month about four weeks in, and they’re still with me — lifetime value on that one client is close to $70K now. Since then, I’ve signed a few more clients, and I’m now at $20K/month in revenue.

### What Connor’s Agency Actually Does

**Daniel:** You do HubSpot stuff, right? Can you break down what your service looks like?

**Connor:** Sure. It’s HubSpot marketing and sales ops — think of it like managing the supply chain of the marketing, sales, and customer success teams. That includes things like reporting, automations, segmentation, CRM cleanup — all the back-end infrastructure that helps those teams function well.

We don’t do lead-facing work like content or outbound outreach — we build the systems, templates, and automations that help teams execute more effectively.

### From \$0 to Multi-Six-Figures in Half a Year

**Daniel:** So you signed a $7K client, and now you’re doing $20K/month. That’s all from working with high-quality clients. Over six months, you’ve probably done somewhere around a quarter of a million dollars?

**Connor:** Roughly, yeah. I hit $96K in five months, and if you add deals that have closed this year, I’d say I’m at about $160K–$170K total. So yeah, reset from zero and turned it into a multi-six-figure business pretty fast.

### Learning Curve and What's Next

**Daniel:** Obviously you had a learning curve. You probably had to unlearn some things and then implement what we teach. What do you think the next six months look like?

**Connor:** My goal for this year is $350K in revenue — so I’m about a quarter of the way there. The aim is a 50–100% increase from last year’s revenue. Based on the pipeline right now, that’s very doable.

### How Connor Is Getting Clients

**Daniel:** Can you give a broad overview of how you’re acquiring customers?

**Connor:** It’s a mix:

* **Cold email** — learned copywriting, deliverability, and audience building inside Client Ascension.

* **Client Ascension referrals** — people now call me “the HubSpot guy.” Probably netted $15K+ from just internal referrals.

* **Twitter** — made a new account when I started and grew to ~1,500 followers. Got a deal or two from there.

Now I’m doing content marketing — posting shorts, repurposing threads, etc. It’s working. There’s a very tangible relationship between execution and audience growth.

### Creating Systems That Scale

**Daniel:** The whole idea here is building **systems** around client acquisition.

A lot of people at <$10K/month are just doing what they feel like doing. We turn it into:

> Check this box → Check this box → Do that every day for months → Scale.

**Connor:** Yeah, and that was me before. I had done consulting via LinkedIn — it was all inbound, sporadic, and correlated with how often I posted. No outbound, no system, no scale.

Once I adopted an actual client acquisition system, everything changed.

It’s predictable now.

### Skipping the Trial-and-Error Phase

**Daniel:** Most people quit too early. They try a channel, it doesn’t work immediately, and they move on. In Client Ascension, we tell you what to do — no testing period. Just execute what’s proven.

**Connor:** That’s 100% true. On your own, there’s a **mental barrier** to execution.

You may know what you should be doing — content, outbound, etc. — but you don’t act on it because you doubt whether it’ll work.

In CA, you get proven systems **and** accountability — which is massive.

### Sales Process and CRM — Where People Lose Money

**Daniel:** So many people lose money simply because they don’t operate a proper **sales process**.

No CRM, no pipeline management. You’re a HubSpot consultant — you see this daily.

**Connor:** Yup. Without a system, you treat every lead as if it’s brand new. You’re reinventing your process every single time. That’s not scalable.

**Daniel:** I’m guessing by now you’re seeing how boring client acquisition becomes. It’s just… repetitive. But it works.

**Connor:** Yeah, getting clients is boring now. But that’s the point. I still get excited when a new lead comes in, but the process itself? Just consistent execution.

Every time. Same discovery questions, same disqualification process. It works.

### Building a Fulfillment Engine

**Daniel:** Are you hiring right now?

**Connor:** Yes. I worked with Kyle from HigherUA for one hire, but now I’m shifting. I’m partnering with a company that specializes in white-label fulfillment for HubSpot agencies.

They’ll handle the back-end. My job is just to **keep their calendar full**.

Then I’ll hire account managers to own client communication and success.

**Daniel:** That’s exactly it. You’ll eventually want someone giving you **daily summaries** of what’s happening inside every client Slack or Teams thread.

### Retention > Acquisition

**Daniel:** Everyone wants more clients — but the real leverage is in **retention**. If someone pays you $7K/month and stays for a year… that’s $84K.

**Connor:** Yep. Retaining good clients is the game. It’s 25x cheaper to **keep** a client than to acquire a new one. Just provide a good service, communicate well, and you’ll be fine.

### Final Thoughts

**Daniel:** Thank you so much for coming on. I’ll leave all of Connor’s links in the description. If you want help with HubSpot or want to follow his journey, go check him out.

**Connor:** Appreciate it, man.

## Ori Interview

    This is Video #31 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Building a $20k/mo Lead Gen Agency inside Client Ascension (Cold Email for Clients)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joz4BiCstzw) - 13 March 2023

### Ori's Journey – From Rock Bottom to Results

**Daniel:** Yo, what's up everybody! I’ve got Ori here — Ori’s awesome and has a really good story. I want to start this with the big picture. Ori, where were you before Client Ascension, and where are you now?

**Ori:** Before Client Ascension, I was closing, but I quit because I got disillusioned with the biz-op offer I was selling.

It wasn’t getting results — not for me, not for clients.

I even gaslit my wife into trying it. She wasn’t getting results either. I finally admitted: this doesn’t work. So I quit.

When I joined Client Ascension, I was at $0/month.

Now? We’re doing anywhere between $15K and $25K per month, but I don’t think in months.

I think in terms of “how many books this week?” I’m just focused on momentum.

### Quitting the Old Life & Facing Reality

**Ori:** I’m 39. People don’t realize how hard it is to make big changes in your 30s.

You get locked into patterns.

Even if you’re miserable, you keep the act going for others — family, friends, high school reunions.

I used to run a hospitality business doing $400–500K/year… at 8% margin. It was miserable.

No one questions it though. You’re just "in it."

In reality, you are just a christmas decoration for your "friends".

Banger.

> In reality, you are just a christmas decoration for your "friends".

But after COVID hit, I realized none of it was real. I ended up working in an Amazon warehouse to survive.

> Amazon Warehouse is infinite suffering.

Imagine that: walking through sketchy neighborhoods, working overtime in a concrete building full of pain, just so I could keep buying Bitcoin because I thought it was going to go up.

### The Turning Point

Two major events shifted everything: my brother went from $20K/year to $200K/year in 9 months by finding a community and leveraging his unique brain.

At the same time, my wife’s family faced health issues.

That’s when I decided: I’m going all in. I started buying Bitcoin, tried Forex (big mistake), and just kept going.

Eventually, someone from a Discord community asked me, "Can you sell?" That led me into high-ticket closing. It was brutal.

Most closers make $4K/month working 12-hour days. I was lucky — I was making $15K–$20K/month.

But even then, I knew the offers I sold didn’t work. And if you’re selling something that doesn’t get results, it messes with your head.

### Discovering My Mutant Power

I posted a list of hard questions for sales offers — institutional-level questions.

It pissed people off. But one guy — Cody — saw my potential.

Turns out, I have this mutant power: I can instinctively give exact sales answers based on personality, customer behavior, and context.

I was helping closers make more money than I was.

Eventually, I got placed on a top offer and closed $8K my first day.

### The Agency Disaster & The Realization

The agency I joined was teaching people to white-label everything — lead gen, fulfillment — using $4/hr VAs from Pakistan.

No results, massive churn, and it felt gross.

I learned that:

- There's no magical $4/hr VA who can get your clients results.

- You need to personally know how to get results before scaling.

- Most people enter from scams — but that’s just how it is. You take the good and leave the bad.

You (Daniel) were the first one who made the hard work mathematical and predictable.

You broke it down:

> Email 1,000 people → 500 open → 10% respond → 20% positive → 8 meetings → 5 show → 1 close.

That clicked for me.

### Offers, Reality, and Cold Email Truth

I learned offer crafting from trying to sell bubble tea. We couldn’t call it tapioca — people thought it looked gross.

So we called it "pomegranate cassava pearls." That’s all offers are.

Packaging and language. Once you see that, you can’t unsee it.

Cold email tells you your true market value.

It strips away the fluff. If you don’t get responses, the market is telling you the truth. You’re not sexy. Period.

### Sustainable Business > Illusions

Now I run a real business. Clients get results. There’s sustainability. The market tells me we’re solving real problems.

You can’t fake it. If you can’t convert cold traffic predictably, your business sucks.

Doesn’t matter what your uncle or dad says. Cold email cuts through everything.

Banger.

> Cold email cuts through everything.

### Systems, Fulfillment, and the Real Game

It’s not just about sending more emails. You need:

-  Offer-market fit

-  Systems for fulfillment, lead gen, and sales

-  Retention over acquisition

Help winners win more. That’s the game. Stop trying to save everyone.

### Final Thoughts & Message to 30-Somethings

You can leave. You can walk away.

Your job, your image, your obligations — they’re not real chains.

You only think they are. People don’t actually care.

Your customers don’t care. Your coworkers don’t care.

If you’ve been stuck in a corporate job for 10 years and feel like you’re wasting your life — you can just leave.

Right now.

It’s not that serious.

Money won’t solve everything, but it will give you clarity. The point is to go for it.

**Daniel:** Thank you for coming on, Ori. That was incredible.

## Long Form Recap - Online Business

!!! tip

    This is Video #33 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Getting Clients, Guarantees, Scaling, Offers, Systems, Lead Generation, Marketing Agencies, Selling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5bpHxz5QIQ) - 30 March 2023

All of a sudden, we’re live in Daniel’s penthouse. For context, it’s not actually mine—but it’s where we’re running the cookouts now.

It started with just the Tampa crew, but now we’ve got Miami folks, and we’re joking about flooding the whole building with Client Ascension members.

The last event cost a ridiculous $48K. The Marriott charged us $3K for bottled water, added charges for forgotten stools—just painful.

Which got me thinking: why not buy a $2M house in St. Pete and host events there instead?

Financially, it would save close to $250K per year.

### Vision for Future Events

I started looking at how $3M/month businesses structure offers.

Cole Gordon, for instance, has three verticals: he trains closers, places them in companies, and runs a mastermind with four annual events for $68K/year.

For Client Ascension, the same model fits.

We could train commission-only cold emailers, add placement as an upgrade, and eventually, run a high-tier mastermind.

Four annual meetups. One hosted at my $3M mansion.

But I’m only doing that if I’m compensated because running large events is pure pain.

### The Execution Gap and the Challenge of Scaling Cleanly

Getting results isn’t the problem.

Getting people to execute is.

I REPEAT, FROM DANIEL.

> Getting results isn’t the problem. Getting people to execute is.

Every piece of effort in Client Ascension is geared toward getting members to just do what we give them.

We literally build your prospect list, write your scripts, and give you the software.

Yet, some still don’t run the campaigns. It’s wild.

The difference? Payment plans. 100% of our best clients are the ones who pay upfront.

They follow instructions.

People on payment plans ask irrelevant questions, delay execution, and lower the energy of the group.

### Why We Don’t Offer Financing

We’re strict for a reason. People ask why we don’t finance access.

Because if $5K is your mortgage, you shouldn’t be here.

We're optimizing for high LTV clients. If you’re annoying, you don’t get in—even if you have the money.

Our group is high energy. Calls are productive because members are focused.

No one wants to hear basic questions like, “Is cold email saturated?” That question alone tells me you’re not ready.

### The Clean Offer Evolution

People get too rigid with their offers.

They think their initial package is set in stone.

Example: if a TikTok ads agency hears a client say, “We already have a media buyer, we just need the creatives,” and the agency turns them away, that’s dumb.

Just sell them the creatives.

You’re a service business. Adapt.

Listen to what people want, and build around that.

This simply means the following.

> Have wiggle Room in Sales. Make something people want.

### Scott Millard’s Offer Transformation

Scott used to sell **unlimited** SaaS explainer videos for $5K/month. Nobody wanted that.

We told him to switch to a fixed number of videos.

He listened, adapted, and six months later, he hit $40K/month. Just that simple.

To discover what people want, go through sales processes (which are always dirty).

### You’re Selling Systems, Not Mechanisms

People think they’re selling short-form content or Google Ads. Wrong.

You’re selling a result. Over time, you learn what works. That becomes your system.

If short-form doesn’t convert well, you need DM sales.

VSLs. Long-form content.

It’s the full stack that drives results.

### Why Most People Fail: Inconsistency

Most people can’t even stick to one thing for six months. That’s why they fail.

It takes six months to:

* Get competent.
* Produce client results.
* Gather testimonials.

You can’t scale if you’re not patient enough to stay in the game.

### Case Study Obsession

If you’ve worked with 642 clients and have zero testimonials, that’s on you.

Your landing page should reflect what you’ve done. If it’s not on the internet, it didn’t happen.

I REPEAT FROM DANIEL:

> If it’s not on the internet, it didn’t happen.

Your sole job is to produce and showcase results.

Case studies lead to more clients. Period.

### The Shakespeare DM Doesn’t Work

Writing poetic DMs isn’t what converts. It’s congruency.

First of all everyone has different conversion windows. Not everyone is just ready to buy at this moment.

People check your profile. If you’re tweeting about random stuff, they bounce.

Have a clean profile, website, VSL, and actual results. If not, at least show what you *would* do.

That one editor? He didn’t wait. He hyper-edited a clip from my VSL, unsolicited.

Daniel wasn't interested at that time, but later he was looking for hyper edited Youtube videos.

He searched for 10 mins in DM's to find this guy and try this out.

A few weeks later, I paid him. Now he’ll make $10–20K from me alone.

Daniel liked this:

> The editor was explaining his work while doing certain things. He was articulating his thought process.

### The Ladder of Proof

There are two ways to mitigate risk for clients:

* Offer a money-back guarantee.
* Provide undeniable case studies.

Client testimonials > Guarantees.

The best clients don’t even want a guarantee. They want *certainty*.

### Building Ubiquity

Don’t ask me if YouTube or Twitter is working best.

I’m everywhere. That’s why it works.

Every app, every channel.

If someone thinks, “I want to scale with cold email,” the first person that comes to mind should be me.

> I want you to see me [30 times a week](https://youtu.be/G5bpHxz5QIQ?t=2877), because you are in a conversion window.

> You are going to the [bank of your mind](https://youtu.be/G5bpHxz5QIQ?t=2909) and you are going to search: "What's the best gateway to make me do this right now. Who is the person that can help me do this as quickly as possible, right now."

> You are going to think about Daniel.

Frequency builds familiarity.

Familiarity drives conversions.

### Stop Pondering, Start Executing

You’re not building your offer. You’re procrastinating.

Execution is:

* Connecting domains
* Uploading the 3,000 leads we gave you
* Copying the exact scripts
* Clicking “Start Campaign”

Do that. Not think about it. Not tweak your logo.

### The Pokémon Binder Analogy

Remember trading Pokémon cards?

The kids who made trades were the ones asking.

The ones sitting quietly with their binder got nothing.

You have to ask. Then adjust if nobody wants your offer. That’s the game.

### Final Advice: Get Good

If you want to stop being poor, pick a skill and actually get good at it.

* Master it.
* Get results.
* Turn results into case studies.
* Let those drive more sales.

Repeat this for a year.

## Daniel Full Story

!!! tip

    This is Video #36 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[$5M/yr Entrepreneur Explains Offers, Marketing, Sales, and Scaling (B2B & Agency)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCAjbRb1ZNk) - 20 April 2023

This is from Daniels POV.

### Daniel Fazio's Business Journey

Daniel shares his journey, beginning with a finance degree from Florida State in 2018.

Just before graduation, he stumbled across a video about making $10,000/month with Amazon FBA.

Treating it like a college class, he studied hard, implemented the strategy, and sent $6,000 to China to buy inventory.

His first product—stainless steel beer bottle insulators—sold out quickly before Father’s Day, netting him around $7-8k in profit.

### The Value of Taking Action Quickly

That early win made me realize something powerful: if I could repeat this, I’d never have to work a job I hated again.

I’d already done time at Publix and Apple—high-performing but micromanaged, efficient but unrewarded.

I hated the lack of autonomy.

I craved a world where **output equals input**.

> I was working more efficient and better quality but I wasn't compensated for that.

### Lessons from Amazon FBA and Capital Efficiency

> Most people is going to be introduced to world of business through some business opportunity.

But Amazon FBA wasn’t sustainable. It was capital-intensive and seasonal.

I wanted a model that was more capital efficient. That’s when Tai Lopez’s SMMA (Social Media Marketing Agency) course showed up.

I devoured it. Immediately, I started running Facebook ads for local businesses.

> I amount of time between of me getting the information and executing it is near zero.

One of those clients—a nightclub owner—stuck with me for years.

### Dream Clients vs. Quantifiable Results

That client didn’t need an ROI breakdown; he trusted me.

But I realized most clients aren’t like that. They need quantifiable results.

That pushed me toward more measurable offers and sharpened my understanding of value propositions.

### From Courses to Cold Emailing

I became obsessed with learning—buying courses and executing fast.

> Russell Brunson (The Idea not directly) - Funnel Copying.

One course taught Instagram automation, and I started selling Instagram growth as a service.

Initially, I pitched “more money” to fitness coaches, but it fell flat.

When I reframed it as “more followers,” everything changed.

### Cold Email Mastery Through Manual Repetition

I didn’t use automation tools at first.

I manually gathered emails and wrote personalized messages.

That gave me an intuitive feel for what works.

So much exposure to cold email through this practice.

Even when I scaled, I kept that 1:1 mindset—speaking to one human being, not blasting a thousand.

### Building a $12K/month Business at 20

At 20, I hit $12,000/month in revenue, with just $400 in expenses.

My clients renewed month after month. I was living the MRR dream.

Fulfillment took just a few hours a week.

The rest of my time went to acquiring more clients.

### Discovering Passion for Customer Acquisition

That’s when I realized—my passion is marketing, not ops.

I love acquiring customers. I also care deeply about **retention**.

Keeping clients is the compounding edge. If you get that right, wealth becomes inevitable.

### The Recurring Revenue Flywheel

- Acquire a customer.

- Get them results.

- Turn those results into case studies.

- Use the case studies to get more customers.

- Repeat.

That flywheel builds unstoppable momentum.

### Revisiting Old Content for New Insights

I revisited Alex Hormozi’s early YouTube videos recently and realized I’d internalized his teachings without even knowing it. 

But this time, at my current stage, the advice hit deeper.

Timing changes everything.

### Challenges for Businesses Below $30K/month

Most service businesses stuck between $5K-$30K/month box themselves into rigid offers.

That’s the mistake. I learned to let the offer evolve based on what clients actually ask for.

**Flexibility** closes more deals.

> You cannot just sell this black box that fits you.

> You can only sell what people want.

### Why Cold Traffic Requires a Complete Offer

Selling ads? Then make the creatives too. Nobody wants half a service.

You’re not just a media buyer.

Clients want someone who owns the outcome. Give it to them.

### Letting Clients Shape the Offer

I’ve built offers mid-call to close deals.

Added services on the fly.

The best “boxes” are shaped by the market, not pre-defined in your Notion doc.

### Dirty Sales: Custom Solutions Win

Early-stage sales are messy.

> You assess the difficulty what's required for them to win. Than backtrack that, what do you want to be compensated with to execute that difficulty.

> Explain the difficulty to the prospect.

> Present them a price that makes economic viable sense for you.

You assess effort, diagnose deeply, and price accordingly.

Don’t try to cookie-cutter your way through a $3K problem.

### Pricing Confidently and Avoiding Undervaluation

Undercharging is fear-based. Know what your work is worth.

Price with clarity. If it’s $6K, say it with your chest.

### Discovery > Revenue DQ

Too many founders auto-DQ prospects based on revenue.

That’s stupid.

Discovery gives you context—savings, risk tolerance, goals.

Every call is market research.

### Using Discovery for Offer Clarity

Talk to 30-50 people and patterns emerge. Language. Pain points.

Behaviors. That becomes the backbone of your email copy, pitch, and offer.

### The Power of High-Effort Outreach

I once sent a clip to a dream client every single day until he signed.

Took two weeks. He’s still a client.

High-value clients require high-effort outreach.

### Sell to the Whole Market, Not Just the Perfect Fit

A $1K deliverable today can lead to a $10K retainer next year.

Play long-term games with long-term people.

### Think in 3+ Year Time Horizons

If you don’t think you’ll be in business in three years, you won’t be.

Period.

Everything I do is aimed at building a company that thrives a decade from now.

### Avoid Rigid Disqualification

Don’t reject people for being “too small.” Ask what they need.

If you can help—even in a small way—you’re building **future revenue**.

### Fulfillment, Marketing, and Client Ascension Structure

> 3 Pillars. Marketing - Lead Gen, Sales, Operations and Fulfillment

In Client Ascension, I handle marketing and lead gen.

Dan runs the sales team.

Andre leads fulfillment. We operate as three full-time machines.

We pass insights back and forth. Coaching calls inform my marketing.

Sales feedback refines fulfillment. The system loops.

### Importance of Frequency and Multi-Channel Presence

It’s never one touchpoint. It’s all of them.

Twitter. YouTube. Cold emails. Podcasts.

It’s about mental bandwidth.

Grant Cardone said it best: “Your creative won’t beat my frequency.”

### Personal Brand vs. Faceless Brands

Client Ascension works because we’re not faceless.

My face. Andre’s face. Christian’s face.

You trust people, not logos.

### Influence of Associations and Network Effect

I’ve appeared in videos with [Brian Moncada](https://www.youtube.com/@BrianMoncada/videos). That association boosts my credibility.

Twitter endorsements helped me hit 100K+ followers.

When a high-profile person joins, others follow from FOMO.

### Sales Advice: Adapt Offers and Play the Long Game

If someone can’t afford your main offer, sell them something smaller.

Stay in touch. The game is won by those who stay in it.

### Display Competence and Do the Work Yourself

If you sell editing, show edits.

If you sell short-form, post clips.

Be your first case study. Prove it. Don’t talk—show.

Make a big document and share on Twitter. Make a youtube video out of it.

> Proof that you are capable doing the thing.

> You have the nuance that is required to deliver the result.

[Opportunities in High Income Skills and Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCAjbRb1ZNk&t=5311s)

### Free Work That Converts

Great free work converts 10-15% of the time.

Bad free work converts 0%.

Make it excellent. Get proof. Build your portfolio.

You are your [first case study](https://youtu.be/aCAjbRb1ZNk?t=6248).

One free client. Yourself.

### Results Over Guarantees

Big clients don’t want their money back. They want the outcome.

Guarantees help early on. But results are what really sell.

### Advice for Beginners

If you’re starting at zero:

* Do the thing yourself
* Get results
* Use free work to build proof
* Lead with proof, not promises

That builds confidence. That closes deals.

### Long-Term Vision and Values

I used to chase monthly highs. Now, I want consistency.

Quarter-over-quarter growth. Sustainable systems. I’m playing a 10–20-year game.

### Role of Faith and Spirituality

I grew up Catholic but drifted. Lately, I’ve been reading the Bible directly.

It’s wild. The stories, the patterns, the parallels to business and life—it’s all there.

Everything repeats. Everything has consequences.

Belief in divine order gives me peace and direction.

### Final Thoughts

Be excellent. Prove it. Stay consistent. Think long-term. Build trust.

That’s the playbook. It’s not flashy, but it wins. Every time.

Despite initial success, Amazon FBA proved capital-intensive and seasonal.

That prompted Daniel to search for something more capital efficient.

Enter Tai Lopez’s SMMA (Social Media Marketing Agency) course.

Daniel consumed the content quickly and implemented it immediately, starting to manage Facebook ads for local businesses, including a club that became a long-term client.
