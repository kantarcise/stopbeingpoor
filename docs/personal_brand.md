# Personal Brand

## Personal Brand from the Glossary

Only way to sell at Market Sophistication Level 5.

You have claim, risk reversal, evidence AND you need to do content marketing that gives upfront value. If you do not do this, when market sophisticates, business will die.

What do I make content on?

- Giving value. You are showing people how to facilitate. What is is that you do?

- They could do it themselves theocratically, however, you are selling to business owners. When they consume this value based content, they are not thinking "I'm going to do this myself" it's like vetting for you, "let me see this guys process".

It just shows competence.

You become the default of it. ***Become the default man.***

Daniel banger:

> Who else will do a webflow series, unless you are a webflow expert.

It's **the association**. You have to be an expert if you post a video on Youtube because every other expert does post a video on Youtube.  

> "Only experts gon on podcasts, so if you are on a podcast, you have to be an expert." That's the thinking pattern.

## Risk & Reward

[Risk & Reward: How to Bet on Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfPiG96S0zI) - 28 December 2023

Let's understand the game.

Your entrepreneurial business is a capital return machine.

Take money, take mental frameworks and models and make sure your venture is able to have the highest return on capital possible.

3 ways to get clients

- **Content** is %100 time.

- **Cold outreach** is little bit of capital and mostly time.

- **Ads** are mostly just capital. 

but this is also true:

- **Content** compounds through followers and authenticity.

- **Cold outreach** is linear.

- **Ads** compound through monopolized attention.

You can only scale content and cold outreach to a local maximums.

### You cannot be able to substantially scale without taking on more capital risk.

Producing content and cold outreach is really comfortable for starters because your perception of time is low.

### You only have so much capital, it's a finite resource. Therefore it must be allocated to the most efficient vehicle possible.

Use is wisely.

### Scrolling on Social

Let's say there is BIllion DAU - each user can get 100 ads in average

It's a 100 Billion pieces of real estate per day. It is fixed.

On social, you are the product, your attention is being sold.

So attention monopolies work with getting the most real estate possible.

Understand this: Compounding effect of purchasing assets also works on attention monopolies.

## Daniel's Story

    This is Video #1 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How I Made $2,500,000 By 25 | My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W16bvJvcTLk) - 15 July 2022

### Part 1 Pre Cold Email Wizard.

#### Amazon FBA

Daniel started with Amazon FBA.

30-40 Youtube videos with pen an paper, just like what I'm doing right now!

At the right time he was selling the right thing!

Nothing was the same after.

He needed a way to make money without using capital.

#### Marketing Agency

You just find businesses, that's the %90 of your job.

Cold emails from Gmail, no domain.

15% of the ad spend on Facebook ads with:

    - Special cards to get drink deals on special days. This worked really well.

[You need to be minimally viably competent on basically every single thing.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=308)

Daniel met some marketing agency people driving Maseratis.

As an actually intelligent person would do, Daniel:

- Look at their page.
- Figure out their service
- Find out what they are charging

And said:

> I know for a fact that I can run the client acquisition better than these people.

And he did.

#### Instagram Agency

This doesn't work anymore, but it was basically follow on follow.

You would follow then unfollow people.

- $97/mo for 500 followers per month

- $147/mo for 1000 followers per month

He emailed 300-400 of fitness coaches at 10 mil followers, **offering work for free** just to have results on my landing page.

He got 5 people.

Here is the fact.

Daniel was manually going through Instagram hashtags and sending out personalized emails 3 hours per day every single day.

That business got to $12k/mo in 4 months.

Instagram got an algorithm update and destroys the entire business overnight.

#### Lead Gen Agency

> I built this Instagram agency using cold email, I am just going to sell what got me here, cold email as a service.

Getting on phone with some real agencies.

Daniel was selling $2k/mo packages and guaranteeing 10 phone calls. It was working pretty well.

Starting to learn CRM's. How to be better at sales calls. High ticket deals can take more than 1 call. Conversion windows.

All the big boy stuff.

[I like to gather attention. I like to generate the phone call, I don't like to execute the phone call in the sales system.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=563)

Low priced course on how to execute cold email campaigns.

"I will put the purchases through a follow up sequence and sign them as clients, they are already going to be presold by the time they get to the phone."

### Part 2 Cold Email Wizard.

TODO.
