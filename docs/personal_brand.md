# Personal Brand

## Personal Brand from the Glossary

Only way to sell at Market Sophistication Level 5.

You have claim, risk reversal, evidence AND you need to do content marketing that gives upfront value. If you do not do this, when market sophisticates, business will die.

What do I make content on?

- Giving value. You are showing people how to facilitate. What is is that you do?

- They could do it themselves theocratically, however, you are selling to business owners. When they consume this value based content, they are not thinking "I'm going to do this myself" it's like vetting for you, "let me see this guys process".

It just shows competence.

You become the default of it. ***Become the default man.***

Daniel banger:

> Who else will do a webflow series, unless you are a webflow expert.

It's **the association**. You have to be an expert if you post a video on Youtube because every other expert does post a video on Youtube.  

> "Only experts gon on podcasts, so if you are on a podcast, you have to be an expert." That's the thinking pattern.

## Risk & Reward

[Risk & Reward: How to Bet on Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfPiG96S0zI) - 28 December 2023

Let's understand the game.

Your entrepreneurial business is a capital return machine.

Take money, take mental frameworks and models and make sure your venture is able to have the highest return on capital possible.

3 ways to get clients

- **Content** is %100 time.

- **Cold outreach** is little bit of capital and mostly time.

- **Ads** are mostly just capital. 

but this is also true:

- **Content** compounds through followers and authenticity.

- **Cold outreach** is linear.

- **Ads** compound through monopolized attention.

You can only scale content and cold outreach to a local maximums.

### You cannot be able to substantially scale without taking on more capital risk.

Producing content and cold outreach is really comfortable for starters because your perception of time is low.

### You only have so much capital, it's a finite resource. Therefore it must be allocated to the most efficient vehicle possible.

Use is wisely.

### Scrolling on Social

Let's say there is BIllion DAU - each user can get 100 ads in average

It's a 100 Billion pieces of real estate per day. It is fixed.

On social, you are the product, your attention is being sold.

So attention monopolies work with getting the most real estate possible.

Understand this: Compounding effect of purchasing assets also works on attention monopolies.
