# Personal Brand

## Personal Brand from the Glossary

Only way to sell at Market Sophistication Level 5.

You have claim, risk reversal, evidence AND you need to do content marketing that gives upfront value. If you do not do this, when market sophisticates, business will die.

What do I make content on?

- Giving value. You are showing people how to facilitate. What is is that you do?

- They could do it themselves theocratically, however, you are selling to business owners. When they consume this value based content, they are not thinking "I'm going to do this myself" it's like vetting for you, "let me see this guys process".

It just shows competence.

You become the default of it. ***Become the default man.***

Daniel banger:

> Who else will do a webflow series, unless you are a webflow expert.

It's **the association**. You have to be an expert if you post a video on Youtube because every other expert does post a video on Youtube.  

> "Only experts gon on podcasts, so if you are on a podcast, you have to be an expert." That's the thinking pattern.

## Risk & Reward

[Risk & Reward: How to Bet on Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfPiG96S0zI) - 28 December 2023

Let's understand the game.

Your entrepreneurial business is a capital return machine.

Take money, take mental frameworks and models and make sure your venture is able to have the highest return on capital possible.

3 ways to get clients

- **Content** is %100 time.

- **Cold outreach** is little bit of capital and mostly time.

- **Ads** are mostly just capital. 

but this is also true:

- **Content** compounds through followers and authenticity.

- **Cold outreach** is linear.

- **Ads** compound through monopolized attention.

You can only scale content and cold outreach to a local maximums.

### You cannot be able to substantially scale without taking on more capital risk.

Producing content and cold outreach is really comfortable for starters because your perception of time is low.

### You only have so much capital, it's a finite resource. Therefore it must be allocated to the most efficient vehicle possible.

Use is wisely.

### Scrolling on Social

Let's say there is BIllion DAU - each user can get 100 ads in average

It's a 100 Billion pieces of real estate per day. It is fixed.

On social, you are the product, your attention is being sold.

So attention monopolies work with getting the most real estate possible.

Understand this: Compounding effect of purchasing assets also works on attention monopolies.

## Daniel's Story

!!! tip

    This is Video #1 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How I Made $2,500,000 By 25 | My Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W16bvJvcTLk) - 15 July 2022

### Part 1 Pre Cold Email Wizard.

#### Amazon FBA

Daniel started with Amazon FBA.

30-40 Youtube videos with pen an paper, just like what I'm doing right now!

At the right time he was selling the right thing!

Nothing was the same after.

He needed a way to make money **without using capital**.

#### Marketing Agency

You just find businesses, that's the %90 of your job.

Cold emails from Gmail, no domain.

15% of the ad spend on Facebook ads with:

    - Special cards to get drink deals on special days. This worked really well.

[You need to be minimally viably competent on basically every single thing.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=308)

Daniel met some marketing agency people driving Maserati's.

As an actually intelligent person would do, Daniel:

- Look at their page.
- Figure out their service
- Find out what they are charging

And said:

> I know for a fact that I can run the client acquisition better than these people.

And he did.

#### Instagram Agency

This doesn't work anymore, but it was basically follow on follow.

You would follow then unfollow people.

- $97/mo for 500 followers per month

- $147/mo for 1000 followers per month

He emailed 300-400 of fitness coaches at 10 mil followers, **offering work for free** just to have results on my landing page.

He got 5 people.

Here is the fact.

Daniel was manually going through Instagram hashtags and sending out personalized emails 3 hours per day every single day.

That business got to $12k/mo in 4 months.

Instagram got an algorithm update and destroys the entire business overnight.

#### Lead Gen Agency

> I built this Instagram agency using cold email, I am just going to sell what got me here, cold email as a service.

Getting on phone with some real agencies.

Daniel was selling $2k/mo packages and guaranteeing 10 phone calls. It was working pretty well.

Starting to learn CRM's. How to be better at sales calls. High ticket deals can take more than 1 call. Conversion windows.

All the big boy stuff.

[I like to gather attention. I like to generate the phone call, I don't like to execute the phone call in the sales system.](https://youtu.be/W16bvJvcTLk?t=563)

Low priced course on how to execute cold email campaigns.

"I will put the purchases through a follow up sequence and sign them as clients, they are already going to be presold by the time they get to the phone."

### Part 2 Cold Email Wizard.

#### The agency and software

Daniel takes off on Twitter.

Here is the question:

> "How can I scale this and make the most amount of money possible?" 

He was pointing the people all the software that he was not in charge of.

So he decided why not own these softwares that people use while learning cold emailing.

[ContactEcom was made using Webflow](https://webflow.com/made-in-webflow/website/ContactEcom-Landing-Page-Template).

> The latest re-design of the newest email marketing and scraping software. SaaS product designed by the Cold Email Wizard and SaaS Wiz on Twitter. Feel free to clone the landing page!

Klean Leads was made too (no longer in service).

They instantly made $20k/mo.

**Mailerrize** for sending cold emails, **quicklines.ai** for auto writing personalized lines into first sentence of cold email, **scrapeinfo** leads scraped form Instagram.

> Running and agency is a phenomenal way to make $60k/mo - $80k/mo but a miserable way to make $200k/mo, so he stopped doing agency.

#### Client Ascension

Help people get from $5k/mo to $50k/mo - $80k/mo.

There are 3 things you can sell:

- DIY (Do it yourself) - courses, software

- DWY (Done with you) - coaching/consulting

- DFY (Done for you) - Agency, hybrid DFY/DWY

Things get at $150k/mo+

So the market when through all the shifts:

- Courses
- High Ticket Coaching
- Hybrid DFY/DWY

You can charge more because the buyer already knows the puzzle piece that they are missing.

They are already sold on the idea. **They are buying speed.**

Here is how things work:

1. Guys below $5k/mo buy courses and low priced memberships

2. Guys $5k - $50k/mo buy coaching

3. Guys $50k/mo+ buy hybrid DFY/DWY and also masterminds (coaching)

4. Everybody buys software

Here is a banger.

> %80 of intelligent business owners don't want to rely on an agency so you might as well have a hybrid done-with-you-done-for-you offer.

People will pay you to design systems in house.

They will buy productized services (design this email, edit this video).

Not "do all the lead generation in the entirely if my company".

!!! example

    Smart customer will say something like this:

    "You are doing great. I think we want to own the expertise (take it in house). I want to replicate this knowledge to other people continuously."

    If you are running an agency, this is what's going to happen all the time.

    So you need a hybrid DWY service.

    If you are smart, you should say:

    "I understand you want to take this in house. How about whoever you go hire, you can buy consulting from me, I will teach them how to do it."

    Now you've extracted more LTV (who was going to churn anyway).

    You need to sell everything.

Here is another banger:

> Your income level is directly proportional to how much social proof you have.

This is simply exponential thing.

Wake up.

## Twitter Masterclass

!!! tip

    This is Video #3 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[Twitter Masterclass: Step-By-Step How To Grow Followers & Make Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSdn-lLZ-og) - 27 September 2022

Step by step.

Follow this.

If you are not saying anything interesting, giving any value or teaching people things you will not get followers regardless of how much engagement you do.

A banger:

[The person on the journey is equally as interesting as the person who has already completed it](https://youtu.be/aSdn-lLZ-og?t=190).

### 0 - 300 Followers

At least 2 tweets per day.

One very good, information giving and valuable thread pinned on your profile.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

> These comments cannot be just rewords of what somebody has already said. You must inject your own anecdotes, your own experience or ADD to what they said.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

### 300 - 1000 Followers

At least 2 tweets per day.

At least 1 thread per week.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

### 3000 - 10000 Followers

At least 3 tweets per day.

At least 1 thread per week.

At least 10 comments on other accounts per day.

Respond to every single comment you get on your own tweets.

Respond to every single DM you get.

Outbound comments (you initiate a comment on somebody elses account) to 10% accounts with above 10k followers, 50% account with 3000 to 10000 followers and 60% to accounts with below 3000 followers.

Just do more. The flywheel.

### Cardinal Rules

- If you are below 1000 followers, tweeting more will not get you more followers because there's nobody to see your tweets.

- If you are below 1000 followers, the biggest driving facotr is the amount of outbound comments you're making.

- As you grow followers, the amount of tweets you put out becomes increasingly more important and outbound comments become less important.

- Responding to all comments on tweets you have, push your tweet back onto the timeline of your followers who are actively on Twitter - thus further increasing the likelihood of engagement on said tweet (do not underestimate this - you MUST do this).

### Follow Conversion Rate

The amount of people that visit your profile divided by how many of those followers visited you.

People only follow you:

- They believe that following you will result in them learning new things
- They are entertained by you
- You have credibility

Your follow conversion rate will be determined by:
- Your bio
- Your pinned tweet

Your bio should do three things:
- State what your account is about
- State any credibility you have
- Call to Action

Your pinned tweet should be either:
- Very Valuable Thread
- A direct link to your offer

### Grow ridiculously fast

Maximize your follow conversion rate. See your analytics at [this page](https://x.com/i/account_analytics).

    - No exceptions. There is no point in making comments, tweets, threads if you are not clearly showing & convincing why people should be following you. You are Burning opportunities. Every single person that visits your profile is an opportunity to gain a follower. This number must be as high as conceivably possible, or everything else you are doing is a waste of time.
    
    - You must be extremely clear about what your profile is about or who you are. If you don't know what you profile is about, say What you plan is. "21 year old attempting his first $10k in the next 6 months. Documenting the journey. Follow me and watch it." 

Increase the amount of outbound comments to 20-40 per day. Space it throughout the day.

When above 1000 followers increase the amount of tweets to 5 per day.

When above 1000 followers increase to 2 threads per week.

### Tools and Tips

Daniel started with TweetHunter.

Join with a link from Daniel's affiliate link [here](https://tweethunter.io/?via=daniel-fazio).

Bookmark your best tweet's and add some of those to **Evergreen** in Tweet Hunter. See the [example here](https://youtu.be/aSdn-lLZ-og?t=609).

Just copy a link of your tweet and add them to Evergreen.

When an Evergreen slot hits in calendar, it takes a tweet from the pool and retweets it automatically.

You can manually schedule a tweet on **Hypefury** as well, here is the [affiliate link](https://hypefury.com/?via=daniel41).

Auto DM's are powerful.

On X/Twitter, you can simply be smart.

On your calendar with Hypefury or Tweet Hunter, you just setup an Auto DM.

Meaning you promise to deliver something to people that likes and or retweets something.

And the tool automatically sends a DM to people who actually does that thing, which is your promise. A link to something valuable.

If you are smart, this could be an opt in, you get your email list going.

### Buying Retweets

You could actually do this, Daniel used to do it. 

But retweets from big accounts.

> Retweets from a 40k account should be worth about $35 each.

A lot of guys charge anywhere between $750 - $1500 for batches of 30 retweets which you contacted from Telegram.

This is just screenshots so Twitter couldn't see the source.

You also have to space it out.

If you are not putting out good content, nobody will sell retweets to you, as expected.

### Making Content

#### Competence Tweets

These shows you know what you're talking about and providing why people should follow you.

Your pinned tweet should be your best competence proving tweet/thread.

!!! example

    Testimonials.

    You just take testimonials and retweet with your link.

another one

!!! example

    Case Studies

    Show how you do stuff, with a thread.


and another one

!!! example

    Proof of Skill

    Show some stripe or gumroad thing.

    I did this.

another one.

!!! example

    Achievements

    Show what you achieved.


another one.

!!! example

    Humble Flexes

    "1m$ on Gumroad yesterday - 80k followers on Twitter today.
    
    You all are too kind
    
    Ily.


#### Engagement Tweets

For the function of gathering attention in the first place.

NEVER stray too far into the path "posting solely to get engagement"

Daniel ALWAYS tweets in his voice.

I repeat.

This is important.

**ALWAYS tweet in your voice.**

If you have a small account, you SHOULD make engagement tweets.

You get a lot of traffic.

!!! warning

    If you only post engagement tweets you will get an audience that only likes engagement tweets.

    Those people do not buy things.

The ideal mix is %20 sales tweets, %65 competence/threads and 15% engagement tweets.

Find the big idea and reword it.

Daniel told you can pause the video and take screenshots of it.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Engagement Tweets 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_one.png)
  <figcaption>Engagement Tweets 1</figcaption>
</figure>

You just find the **big idea** of the tweet, and reword it.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Engagement Tweets 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_two.png)
  <figcaption>Engagement Tweets 2</figcaption>
</figure>

You just find the **big idea** of the tweet, and reword it.

Don't ever copy people. Think foy 

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Engagement Tweets 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Engagement Tweets 3 </figcaption>
</figure>

You just find the **big idea** of the tweet, and reword it.

I know I repeated this 3 times.

It is the important sentence.

#### Sales Tweets

Direct calls to action pointing people somewhere.

Can run these tweets as ads to your own followers.

Here are some screenshots to get the ideas.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Sales Tweet 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 1 </figcaption>

Straight up selling.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Sales Tweet 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 2 </figcaption>

With claim, as expected.

  ![Sales Tweet 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 3 </figcaption>

Claim wording is critical.

  ![Sales Tweet 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/engagement_tweets_three.png)
  <figcaption>Sales Tweet 4 </figcaption>
</figure>

This was the internet money sale.

### Threads

The entire performance of a thread will be dictated upon the first tweet, and more particularly the first sentence.

You NEED to learn how headlines are written, and Daniel recommends the book by [Michael Masterson "Great Leads"](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Leads-Easiest-Start-Message-ebook/dp/B007I6MEUI).


**Bad Thread**: "My first writing client paid me X. My last one paid me Y. Here is what changed."

**Good Thread**: "The automated onboarding flow that has increased my ecom client's revenue by 30% in just 60 days."

See an example:

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Thread Tweet 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/offers/thread_tweet_one.png)
  <figcaption>Thread Tweet 1 </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Thread Topics

> **Less Time**: “How I went from benching 225 to 300 pounds only working out 3 times per week within just 72 days”  

> **Less Effort**: “Here’s how I make 7 threads, 10 LinkedIn posts, 8 Instagram Reels, and 9 TikToks from just one single video”

> **Handling the Objections Your Audience Has**: “A lot of agencies think cold email won’t work for them if they’re not charging $3,000 a month or more. But it does actually work, and I’ll explain how in this thread”  

> **Answering the Questions Your Audience Has**: “How do I X?” — Answer it

### Stealing Content

You could steal content (not steal but be a detective really).

Just know that there is a [Twitter Advanced Search](https://x.com/search-advanced).

### Why Respond DM's

70%-90% of your DM's will be people asking questions in regards to content you have just posted.

This is the source of how you make new content.

### Reword your own tweets

Go into Twitter advanced search and search your best performing tweets between particular dates and reword them

You can also do this with other people's profiles.

### Increasing Engagement

Respond to all comments on your tweets. This continuously pushes your tweet higher.

Twitter is a feed. If you interact with a tweet it pushes it back to the top for other people.

Responding to all comment on your tweet automatically doubles the comment count of every post (this is true of every social media post, Daniel does this on Youtube and Instagram aswell). 

Here’s the full text from the image:


### Call to Actions

The entire function of all of this is to point people somewhere.

You SHOULD not be doing this unless you're pointing somebody somewhere.

1. If you have your product figured out → point them to a landing page

2. If you haven’t have your product figured out → point them to follow you
   
  a. “If you liked this tweet, would really appreciate a follow as I’ll be putting out more content like this regularly!”
  
  b. “If you liked this thread, throw me a follow and comment your questions below! I’ll be making more threads this week and would love your inputs”

Do this. It works.

## Interview with Brooke - Client Ascension Member

!!! tip

    This is Video #6 on [Daniel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@danielfazio).

[How Brook Made $55,000 in Two Months (Agency Owner Interview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ubUWUIHN0I) - 14 October 2022

**Daniel:** What's up everybody! I’ve got Top G Brooke here. He’s been in Client Ascension for around 4–5 months. How you doing brother?

**Brooke:** Good brother, how are you?

**Daniel:** Phenomenal. Let's start with a quick intro—what do you do, what are you selling, how much are you making right now?

**Brooke:**

* I started an e-commerce store about a year ago.
* We’ve done $3.7M in the past year.
* I've stepped out of the business recently—team runs it.
* Now I’m focusing on advertising and started from scratch when I joined Client Ascension.

### Business Model

* **Agency Growth Partner Offer:**

  * We target stores smaller than mine.
  * Help scale them with email marketing, Google Ads, Facebook Ads.
  * Flexible depending on the store’s needs.
  * If I can’t help, I refer within the Client Ascension network.

* **Coaching Program:**

  * Helps people build a store from scratch.
  * Goal: get them successful enough to transition into the agency.
  * Fully structured Ascension model: a product for every stage.

**Daniel:** You've basically cloned the Client Ascension model. Course first, then agency.

### Revenue and Growth

* **Month 1 (August):** $30K (mostly coaching)
* **Month 2 (September):** $25K (mostly agency)
* Goal: $50–60K by November/December
* Launching a more formal agency structure soon

### Content Strategy

* Collaboration with Connor:

  * Rapid-fire Q\&A sessions for content.
  * Send each other list of questions and hop on a call to answer.
  * Not podcast-style, just high-output content clips.

* **Lead Sources:**

  * Coaching clients: Twitter inbound
  * Agency clients: cold email (learned via Client Ascension)

**Brooke:** Cold email brought in all agency clients. I knew nothing about it before CA.

---

### Offers and Pricing

* Currently testing a **performance-based pricing model**:

  * Take a baseline from past revenue
  * Earn 25% of the increase
  * Requires clients to provide access & execute quickly

* **Challenges:**

  * Clients delay giving ad account access or creative assets
  * Considering adding deadlines & minimum retainers for compliance

---

### Fulfillment and Scaling

* **Strengths:**

  * Google Ads, website conversion

* **Weak areas:**

  * Email marketing (outsourced within CA)

* Current agency structure:

  * \$3K setup fee → used for fulfillment outsourcing

* **Future Plan:**

  * Focus on coaching to attract better agency clients
  * Potential private equity-style deals
  * Build fulfillment team when agency hits \$50K/month

---

### Operational Challenges

* At \$25K/month, fulfillment is overwhelming
* Needs SOPs, Looms, defined roles
* Working on team-building with Andre’s help

> "Every SOP you make is a 10x ROI in two months."

**Daniel:** Most people don’t pass \$50K/month because they can’t scale fulfillment.

---

### Advice for New Agency Owners

**Brooke:**

* **Have a skill**—doesn’t matter what, just be good at something
* **Volume matters**—contact thousands
* **Analyze your performance:**

  * A/B test scripts
  * Double down on what works
  * Always optimize

> "Send 5,000 emails. 3 people will say yes."

* Don’t use overused lead magnets/scripts—write your own
* Learn to manage the full sales cycle (multi-call closes, ghosting, re-engagement)

---

### Takeaways from Client Ascension

* **Content & Coaching:**

  * Tactical, specific, and applicable to real business

* **The Community:**

  * 140+ like-minded individuals
  * Constant motivation and collaboration
  * Exposure to world-class operators in every topic

**Brooke:** Growing up in Toronto, I didn’t have many people around me doing this. Being inside this group is next level.

---

**Daniel:** I’m going to drop Brooke’s links below—Twitter, YouTube. Go check him out. Thanks for coming on, brother.

**Brooke:** Of course brother. Happy to be here. Thanks for having me!
