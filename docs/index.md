# Intern at Client Ascension

Daniel [explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZWoYgLnjaM) how to embrace uncertainty beautifully.

While he was in collage he used note cards and write his questions down.

And as he figured things out he take it off the wall, crumble it and throw it in the trash.

This is my list of question cards.

My internship at Client Ascension.

I tried to buy [Internet Money](https://whop.com/internet-money/) but it's no longer on sale.

I have to get to a place where I can apply to [Client Ascension](https://www.clientascension.io/).
