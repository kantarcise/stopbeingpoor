# Glossary

Glossary is an alphabetical list of words relating to a specific subject, text, or dialect, with explanations; a brief dictionary.

This glossary is mainly made from this Video - [A Step-by-Step, A-Z Checklist for Building a Successful Agency to $50k/mo+ (Cold Email & Marketing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ5V6rrxInk).

## Important Words

### 90 Day Increments

Daniel banger:

> [Everything you want in life is gated between 90 day increments.](https://youtu.be/BZ5V6rrxInk?t=1754)

### A/B Tests

You do volume, that's a requirement.

But as you do volume, you purposefully improve what you are doing.

[You have 5 different mails](https://youtu.be/_ubUWUIHN0I?t=859), you send 1000. You see that 4 of them doesn't work. You cut them down.

### Acquisition System

Doing two things.

> Acquire more customers, make more money on existing customers.

### Agency

[I still don't know.](https://youtu.be/Joz4BiCstzw?t=895)

Daniel simply says:

> It's a service company.

### Ascension Model

Daniel talks about [the model here](https://youtu.be/_ubUWUIHN0I?t=114).

Help people at every level and know that they will get to the next level.

Sell everything.

Every point someone is going to buy something different.

Here is something similar [from this website](https://predictableprofits.com/ascending-your-way-to-bigger-profits/):

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Ascension Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantarcise/stopbeingpoor/refs/heads/main/docs/images/glossary/AscensionModelExample.png)

</figure>

Smart.

### AOV

The [banger video](https://youtu.be/NJhjg9QLvcI?t=1175).

The Google ads agency works with specific type of ecommerce brands.

> Their AOV (Average Order Value) has to be $200 or more.

Otherwise the service seems like doesn't work.

### Association

You need one word associations.

What do you do. You become "that_word" guy.

### Auto DM

On X, you can simply be smart.

On your calendar with [Hypefury](https://hypefury.com/?via=daniel41) or [Tweet Hunter](https://tweethunter.io/?via=daniel-fazio), you just setup an Auto DM.

Meaning you promise to deliver something to people that likes and or retweets something.

And the tool automatically sends a DM to people who actually does that thing, which is your promise. A link to something valuable.

If you are smart, this could be an opt in, you get your email list going.

### Branding

- Are you positioning yourself as the expert on the X topic?

- Are people referring to you as the expert on the X topic?

### Broker

Facilitating a transaction between 2 people.

For example there are Real Estate Brokers and Real Estate Agents which work for brokers.

### Building a Business

[Here is a simple truth. You cannot white label stuff.](https://youtu.be/Joz4BiCstzw?t=1161)

There is no magic 4$/hour VA from some country to help you with fulfillment.

You actually need to know how to fulfill.

Then when you hire someone, you are the one teaching.

### Case Study

Once you get your first customer. All you need is a massive case study.

David [explains here.](https://youtu.be/BRS-qlwoCQI?t=1138)

> If I could get this massive case study, everything else just happens inevitably.

Another banger from [this long form](https://youtu.be/G5bpHxz5QIQ?t=1263):

> You did not any results unless they are clearly and vividly displayed on the internet.

> Your landing page should reflect what you’ve done. If it’s not on the internet, it didn’t happen.

### Churn

Literally understand from example - [Dillon Case Study](https://www.clientascension.io/case-studies/dillon-andrews):

> Dillon experienced client churn when he initially scaled to 10 clients, losing half of them due to inefficiencies in his fulfillment process. He realized that without a solid system in place, further growth would be unsustainable.

### Claim

Part of an offer.

> "I'll do this and I will make you this much"

Your offer can simply state to the customer with 3 options, here is a part of the Client Ascension offer from Daniel:

- You can not do this.
- You can do it yourself.
- You get in a time machine and join Client Ascension.

### Client

Daniel says it's going to [take 6 months](https://youtu.be/aCAjbRb1ZNk?t=6370) to get a client.

The function of 6 months is not you prospecting for 6 months.

It's you becoming actually good at the thing for 6 months.

### Client Ascension Goal

Daniel [explains this](https://youtu.be/pHpLrRgBGP0?t=921) beautifully:

> If we sat here and dirty scale, we could get to much higher MRR and not care about the students at all.

> I don't want that.

> I wanted to have longevity. I will do a call with every single student. Multiple calls. There are systems specifically to increase the speed with which people get results.

> I need it to be clean. I need the highest possible percentage of people to see extreme success as possible.

### Client Expectation

[Why should we sell to rich people?](https://youtu.be/NJhjg9QLvcI?t=2169)

If someone is paying you 1000$, they wanna make minimum 10-15k in 10 days.

That's how they are operating.

They need you to save their business. They **need** you to make a 10x 15x.

Someone makes a 1M-5M$/year, he pays you 10k he is really cool with getting 20.

He is shocked if you make him 5x.

Because the previous guys he hired did not do what they said they are going to do.

He 

### Cold Calls

From [this banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR5rxXycrV8).

Everyone knows cold calling works, but it’s hard to hire, train, and retain SDRs.

Cold calls let you uncover objections you’d never find in email.

You can navigate it in a call.

If someone gets a call from us selling cold calls, it proves the method works.

### Cold Email

A cold email is an unsolicited e-mail that is sent to a receiver without prior contact.

Cold email is a demand capture mechanism.

3 parts: **Lead gen**, **craft emails** and **responding**.

Everything has to be right: Offer - VSL - Landing Page and the Cold Email Strategy - Your leads. That's when you make a successful business.

Just know this, it takes time. 2 weeks is not enough to measure a cold email campaign. Everyone you cold email has s*** going on in their life. 1 - it's not the right time. 2 - they need to be hit with different angles overtime.

So stats are aggregated. You should close 1 person from 1000 mails. But this will happen in a 90 day window.

- **Lead gen**: [ListKit](https://www.listkit.io/pricing) (ListKit - Only pay for verified lists) is superior to [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) (Credits for List - 40% bounce, you burn your domain - email cleaning - you lose %40 mails you bought), craft emails and responding. You can do a lot of cool stuff in Listkit for filtering.

- **Craft Emails**: The way you write a cold email will depend on a lot of things. Market sophistication level and who you are emailing. Do we do Loom videos?

- **Response Handling**: This is just about inbox management. You might get a response to a cold email in 5 months. This is normal. Everyone you email is going to go through their own conversion cycle.

If your offer is bad, you cannot make cold emails work. You need a solid funnel. Your script has to be right. Who you are targeting has to be right. Follow-ups and responses has to be right.

You can use cold email to make a demand capture offer to a demand generation offer in 2 ways:

- Morph the offer with some uniqueness.

- Cold emailing with relevant indicators. (They are hiring specific type of person - they are using a specific type of technology on their website. You scrape lists like that)

### Cold Traffic

Cold traffic is someone that is not familiar with you, your brand, your solution, or product/service.

Cold Traffic is the new blood of the business.

It is a critical part of your marketing system because it involved reaching out to people in your target market.

### Cold Outreach

Bigger term including Cold Emails.

### Compounding

The [banger video](https://youtu.be/cLtC6IiGUjI?t=1069).

Compounding effects apply to every aspect of everything in life.

You competencies is going to compound.

### Consultative Sales

Banger [video](https://youtu.be/FepWs1qV3xg?t=381).

> "Thanks for getting on the call. You’re running a business, which likely means your goal is profit. If it’s okay, I’d like to ask a few questions to determine if this is financially viable for both of us. If I feel confident, I’ll give you an offer and possibly even a guarantee."

Then ask:

* What kind of business do you run (B2B or B2C)?
* Who are you targeting?
* Is your market reachable through cold email?
* How much do you charge?
* How many clients would you need to break even with our service?

This is a financial conversation.

### Conversion Windows

From [Client Ascension blog](https://www.clientascension.io/blogs/how-to-get-your-first-10-customers).

One final, crucial point: not everyone is ready to buy right now.

People have different timelines, priorities, and challenges. Don't get discouraged if leads don't convert immediately.

Focus on nurturing those leads and providing value.

Stay top-of-mind through consistent content and engagement.

When their "***conversion window***" opens, you'll be the first person they think of.

Building a successful business takes time and effort. But by focusing on these four pillars – claims, proof, competency, and consistency – you'll set yourself up for long-term success.

Another [banger here](https://youtu.be/-kwCI7-g2Nk?t=248)

**Conversion Window** = the time between someone discovering your offer and finally purchasing.

You need to **shorten this window** — and how do you do that?

You increase **frequency**.

You need to market so **hard** and **so consistently** that you become the default option in your category.

### Convince Themselves

When you have [interviews on Youtube](https://youtu.be/8KDXT_shpwc?t=911) - social proof.

Your prospects will have the ability to develop parasocial relationships with you.

On their OWN TIME.

You have 35 interviews.

Your prospects gradually convince themselves that they like you. Continuously, overtime.

### Copywriter

Copywriting is the art of producing text for promotional, marketing, instructional, or advertising purposes.

The goal of this content is typically to persuade, inspire, entertain, educate, or inform a reader in order to increase brand awareness or authority, sell a product, describe a course of action, or to convince a person or group of people to take a specific step. 

### Courses

From Daniel on this [banger video](https://youtu.be/deAzlMzvhRU?t=712):

You have been psyoped into thinking that all courses are scam.

Every single person I know who makes an insane amount of money purchases courses and mentorships and spends more than he would otherwise think it's necessary.

Always. I do this all the time. I buy courses all the time.

### CRM

CRM stands for customer relationship management, which is a system for managing all of your company’s interactions with current and potential customers.

The goal is simple: improve relationships to grow your business.

CRM technology helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.

### Default Option

This is what you are trying to be. From [this banger](https://youtu.be/8KDXT_shpwc?t=567):

You are not trying to convert people now.

You're trying to permanently exist and be the default option for when they do.

Who wins?

- Someone with 300 podcast episodes, 72 Youtube videos and case studies.

- Some random person.

### Deliverable

From this [banger tweet](https://x.com/blackhatwizardd/status/1849157663398965449).

"Data" is not an offer. It's just a thing.

This guy's client does not do anything for his customers. He just gives them a giant sheet of data.

The usage of that data, which is contingent upon having a cold email tech stack, is the thing that can be formed into an offer.

This "offer" is not really an offer - it's just a deliverable.

But there's nothing wrong with deliverable based businesses. People buy it.

However, they only buy it if they're already looking for it.

You cannot generate demand for a deliverable based offer. You must capture it where it already exists.

Therefore, this is a demand capture offer and NOT a demand generation offer (See [Demand Capture Offers](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#demand-capture-offers) and [Demand Generation Offers](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#demand-generation-offers))

### Demand Capture Offers

Web Desing! You sell web design to people already looking for websites.

### Demand Generation Offers

A unique twist on a Demand Capture offer. You do websites in a unique way.

Example: You do websites that have monitoring software that prevents fraud for e-commerce clients.

You have to position a demand capture offer to a demand generation offer as hard as possible.

Here are more examples in raw format:

- Getting People More Leads with Ads

- Converting more free trial users with email marketing.

- Helping people build a personal brand on Twitter.

- LinkedIn automated outreach

- UGC ad creatives

- Influencer Marketing

- Short Form Content

- Cold Call, Cold Email, Webinars, Any Kind of Ad, Anything typically that produces more traffic

### Demand Capture - Demand Generation Scale

You want to find out what your offer sits in this scale. For Demand Capture offers, you'll need more volume.

### DFY Client Selection

Daniel talks [about this](https://youtu.be/NJhjg9QLvcI?t=1126):

> Pricing is a filtering mechanism.

> SMMA YouTubers blame themselves for client churn, but they’re working with terrible businesses. You can’t get results for broke people.

> Exactly. People assume “business” = money. But local businesses often make nothing. Go meet the owner—it’s not what you expect.

### EBIDTA

EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

It’s a way to measure a company's profitability by focusing on the core operations, ignoring costs that might vary between companies (like debt interest or how they depreciate assets).

Here is an example:

!!! example

    Imagine a small business that runs a coffee shop:

    **Revenue**: $500,000

    **Operating Costs** (salaries, rent, coffee beans, etc.): $300,000

    **Depreciation of equipment**: $20,000

    **Interest on loan**: $10,000

    **Taxes**: $30,000

    To calculate EBITDA:

    Start with Net Income (say it’s $140,000)

    Add back:

    Interest: $10,000

    Taxes: $30,000

    Depreciation: $20,000

    (No amortization here)

    EBITDA = 140,000 + 10,000 + 30,000 + 20,000 = $200,000

    So the EBITDA is $200,000, showing how much the business earns from core operations, before loans and tax strategies come into play.

### Engaged Lead

[Alex video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy76mzEt_SI).

A person you can contact who's shown interest in the stuff you sell.

### Evidence

Part of an offer. Can you actually do the thing you are claiming?

It's is critical to aggregate evidence and present it in a correct way.

### Execution Time

From [this banger.](https://youtu.be/aCAjbRb1ZNk?t=456)

> I amount of time between of me getting the information and executing it is near zero.

### Free Cash Flow

From this [banger video](https://youtu.be/MfPiG96S0zI?t=327).

Free cash flow shows how much cash a company has left over after paying for expenses, making it an indicator of financial health.

Daniel approach:

Revenue - business expenses - living expenses.

### Free Client

All of you have [one free client](https://youtu.be/2GaqJ-QQO3g?t=360) that requires zero dollars and zero effort to sign: yourself.

### Free Work

This is [a encouraging fact](https://youtu.be/aCAjbRb1ZNk?t=6121).

> Every single client that we've worked for free in attempt to sign them we have signed.

Daniel says this is 10-15 percent at scale.

### Follow Up

Here [is the video](https://youtu.be/deAzlMzvhRU?t=1157).

After you've sent some free work, if you do not get a response, follow up.

Follow up again and again.

Keep following up until you get a yes or no.

### Frequency

This [banger](https://youtu.be/-kwCI7-g2Nk?t=50).

Frequency is, it’s how many separate times somebody sees your offer in a given time frame.

So if someone sees your offer seven times per week, your weekly frequency is seven.

### Funnel

You can just get [Clickfunnels 2.0](https://www.clickfunnels.com/).

Parts are: Headline as offer, VSL, book call, automation (someone books a call you actually get noticed and you now what to say after), [typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) for assessment, [calendly](https://calendly.com/) for calendar.

### Fulfillment

How do you make sure the clients you sign consistently are able to get results, and how do you make sure your business runs smoothly?

2 components two keeping a client.

- Client Results (see: [Claim](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#claim))
- Client Experience (no one talks about this which is **insane**)

If your client does not have a relationship with you they will leave when there is a better claim, which will happen inevitably (see [Market Sophistication Level 5](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#market-sophistication-level-5)).

If your client likes you, they are going to give you more leeway to correct. (See: [Variance](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#variance))

Client Ascension teaches this, you make sure your clients business is working well.

Banger ideas:

- Make automated results.

- Be very transparent with about what's happening.

as a result, people just like you.

Nick added:

> If there is a communication delay and the client does not like you, there is no reason to keep you around.

Daniel adds:

> People keep working with an agency JUST BECAUSE they found the agency as a good person. This actually happens. 

Be a good person:

- Being on time - transparent timelines.
- Be someone who is considerate on their business and their agenda, not just your own.
- Sent gifts.
- We hang out.

and there is incredible opportunity here for more.

Here is [a banger video](https://youtu.be/hvJoq6PjLzs?t=926) from Dylan Rich to show how a customer is fulfilled on a sales process.

The good sales performance was:

- Sales guy did extra work

- After the initial sells call, he shot a video to describe how the platform worked

- He made a sample lead list (which what they are selling) in terms of Dylan's needs / wants 

- He gave Dylan a sample dataset for Dylan's team to go cold call.

- He went above and beyond.

The bad sales performance:

- Attitude

- No connection

- Just going through motions

### Goodwill

You can invest your knowledge [in terms of goodwill](https://youtu.be/Wed3AJSq_cQ?t=351).

Just like how you invest your capital into stock market and get a return.

You can invest goodwill as well.

Goodwill at scale.

### Growth

How do you grow a business?

Chandler [explains](https://youtu.be/cLtC6IiGUjI?t=687):

> Grow demand to the point where it starts to break operations and than repair operations to be able to sustain that demand.

This is a cycle.

We just keep repeating.

If you do not break anything you are never going to grow.

### High-Ticket Sales

A high-ticket offer provides high value for your customers—at a high price.

What high-ticket item look like varies wildly based on the goods and services you provide, but for many makers, it’s through courses, coaching, community-building, or productized services.

### Hiring

How do you hire people to help you in your business?

Problems:

- Not hiring anyone.
- Hiring the wrong people.

### Internal VSL

[Banger video](https://youtu.be/NJhjg9QLvcI?t=440).

Business is a different game at every level.

When you want to do a change in the company, you need to communicate it.

When company gets big, you kinda have to do a internal VSL just to have all of the people understand what's going to happen.

### Instant Gratification

I believed in doing the right things consistently.

I didn’t focus on a number, just discipline and [detachment from instant gratification](https://youtu.be/RR5rxXycrV8?t=271).

Chop the wood.

### Internet Money

No longer on sale.

Daniel sent daily emails and asked for replies for the completion of watching videos from the members.

### Landing Page

Needs a Youtube Video.

Potential Client: "I watched 2 mins of this video, this guy gives value - he knows what he is talking about."

### Lead

A lead is a person you can contact.

### Luck

Listen to [this story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCAjbRb1ZNk&t=5311s) when you want to be lucky.

### LTV:

Lifetime Value of a Customer.

The total amount of money the average customer will spend over their lifetime with you.

### Maility

What is [this](https://app.maility.io/auth/register) ? 🤔

### Making Money

Daniel from [this banger](https://youtu.be/NJhjg9QLvcI?t=1783):

> There are only two ways to make a lot of money: be the cheapest, or be the most expensive. The middle is death.

Just look at the socio-economics distribution of the population.

Middle class is very small. You cannot charge middle class.

A lot of people don't have any money. A really small amount of people have all the money.

### Market Cycle

There is going to be offers.

They have specific time spans. Which means they have a cycle.

You can position yourself as the authority.

You need to be in a room where people stay ahead of the curve.

### Market Sophistication

Basically, how many competitors you have.

Level 5, maximum amount of competitors - e-commerce email marketing. It's hyper competitive. In 2012 you can go to any e-com brand - "Hey do you need Facebook ads?" that would just sell. No one did it.

At Level 1, you basically have no competitors.

When a market gets sophisticated, the prospects get exposed to more claims and angles.

### Market Sophistication Level 5

The hardest game. Every single offer will eventually be level 5.

Just sophisticate the market yourself, that's what being taught in Client Ascension.

This is the best positioning you can stand.

### Marketing

From this [banger video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mehSj3hik8k).

Marketing is being able to anticipate the question that somebody is going to have before they ask it.

Another approach [Marketing as a Gym](https://youtu.be/genAUzah4Yo?t=996).

Marketing is like sets in the gym.

A set is a month: 4 YouTube videos, 10 Twitter threads, 20 LinkedIn posts, 500 DMs, 4,000 cold emails.

You want to grow?

Add volume, hire help, and increase the set.

Progressive overload.

It’s inevitable — results come if you keep lifting.

### New Customers vs Retaining Customers

The [website](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers).

Depending on which study you believe, and what industry you’re in, acquiring a new customer is anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one.

### Non Refundable

I think Daniel likes running this.

It is to make sure the client actually follows the program.

Make something non refundable if they do not complete everything on a list. Here is [the video](https://youtu.be/_ubUWUIHN0I?t=428).

### Not Stressed

Here is [the video](https://youtu.be/NJhjg9QLvcI?t=217).

Client ascension works. That means you will get clients.

Now you have to actually fulfill them.

> What do we do with all the people that signed up?

Dillion was stressed about working so much and wanted to go back working a job.

Trello board was built with Andre, got a VA.

Andre [wasn't stressed out](https://youtu.be/NJhjg9QLvcI?t=315).

He knew what needed to be done.

### Objections

Email your list [more](https://youtu.be/8KDXT_shpwc?t=801).

> If you ram enough social proof all objections go out the window.

Here is what the lead will think.

> "There is no conceivable way the objection I have made in my mind is feasible if this many people are getting this sheer quantity of results."

!!! tip

  This is what happens.

  37 case studies.

  97 screenshots.

  Just stack.

### Offer

From this [banger tweet](https://x.com/blackhatwizardd/status/1849157663398965449).

An **offer** is a set of deliverables that help a client reach a specific quantifiable goal.

"Sign 10 clients in the next month with cold email" is an offer.

"Increase your revenue by a minimum of $25k/mo with our email flows" is an offer.

It's an "offer" when the facilitation of it can lead to an end goal.

You need to do one clear thing, for one clear person, with one clear outcome and one clear risk reversal with one clear evidence that you are able to do that.

What you do, who you serve, what the terms are?

Daniel [banger definition](https://youtu.be/_ubUWUIHN0I?t=925).

Something people want to purchase.

Argument in convincing reason to which why somebody should work with you specifically.

There are ways to do this. You do not have to be the expert and simply say, "I did this, if you want I can teach you".

Offer crafting, just change the wording LOL.

[Tapioca in Portuguese - Cassava Pearls](https://youtu.be/Joz4BiCstzw?t=969)

### Operations

What do I hire people for? How do I pick people? How do you train people?

You want to offload some work, but in reality your work is more (in the beginning).

Questions:

- How do you make a client management infrastructure?

- How do you track all the things that needs to be done?

- How do you make sure everyone is doing things that they need to do?

- How do you make sure the people you hire actually stay with you and build a company culture.

- How do you get them to go above and beyond?

### Opportunities

If you understand the client needs something else as a priority other than what you offer, you can just use the opportunities channel in slack and find some people to split the revenue.

### Parasocial Relationships

[Banger video here](https://youtu.be/aSdn-lLZ-og?t=339)

When people like you, but you don't even know they exist.

Parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships, where one person extends emotional energy, interest and time, and the other party, the persona, is completely unaware of the other's existence.

### Personal Brand

Only way to sell at Market Sophistication Level 5.

You have claim, risk reversal, evidence AND you need to do content marketing that gives upfront value. If you do not do this, when market sophisticates, business will die.

What do I make content on?

- Giving value. You are showing people how to facilitate. What is is that you do?

- They could do it themselves theocratically, however, you are selling to business owners. When they consume this value based content, they are not thinking "I'm going to do this myself" it's like vetting for you, "let me see this guys process".

It just shows competence.

You become the default of it. ***Become the default man.***

Daniel banger:

> Who else will do a webflow series, unless you are a webflow expert.

It's **the association**. You have to be an expert if you post a video on Youtube because every other expert does post a video on Youtube.  

> "Only experts gon on podcasts, so if you are on a podcast, you have to be an expert." That's the thinking pattern.

Another [banger video](https://youtu.be/RR5rxXycrV8?t=936)

People fear committing to a personal brand.

Ironically, it gives flexibility to pivot.

Because you are building a group of people who trust what you will say.

There is no down side. It just takes resources.

### Pitch

This is from [Cole Gordon VSL](https://closers.io/).

The pitch is how the offer is communicated over the phone to the prospect in a way that is unique, different and superior than the rest of the marketplace.

### Proof as a Beginner

[This banger](https://youtu.be/386ncFwz7B0?t=515). Directly from [the document](https://gamma.app/docs/How-to-Get-Use-Social-Proof-to-Sign-More-Clients-hjynkqp49sikg42?mode=doc).

You'll typically hear me say things like "it takes 6-8 months to start getting any traction in your business"

The reason for this 6-8 months is SOLELY, 100%, EXCLUSIVELY due to the time delay of acquiring case studies.

Your business & client acquisition will immediately & indistinguishably start moving extraordinarily faster at the exact moment you produce your first good case study.

When you are a beginner, you need to take what you can get.

You don't have the luxury of charging people $5,000 - $10,000 and putting them on 6 month contracts when you have precisely zero proof.

So let's say you sign a client for free.

Here's a huge mistake people will make when signing a free clients: they will not share their intentions.

The only situation you should sign a free client as a beginner is if you have made this abundantly, 100% absolutely clear: I am only doing this for a case study. You are agreeing to share any and all metrics, numbers, and sales as a result of our working together. There is no other function of this relationship beyond me producing a case study.

This is the reason "90% of businesses fail":

They don't even exist long enough to produce case studies, social proof, and results.

All of this will occur after month 6.

After you have been making almost no money for an extremely long period of time. Building up competence. Actually becoming the person capable of delivering results.

Stop giving up on the thing. Start getting case studies.

### Prospect

Potential client.

### Q/Q

Quarter over quarter (Q/Q) is a measure of an investment or a company's growth from one quarter to the next.

### Response from Cold Email

If someone is going to reply to your cold email, they will %100 Google you.

### Results Over Guarantees

Some clients [don't care about guarantees.](https://youtu.be/G5bpHxz5QIQ?t=2438)

They just want you to deliver the result that you promised.

Daniel says:

Quantifiable case studies and testimonials is by an order of magnitude stronger than guarantees.

### Referrals

[Banger video](https://youtu.be/RR5rxXycrV8?t=689).

They might not need my cold calling service.

But they definitely know someone who does.

### Retention

Everyone wants more clients — but the real leverage is in **retention**.

If someone pays you $7K/month and stays for a year… that’s $84K.

Daily narrates of what we did as part of fulfillment.

Daniel thinks [this is a puzzle](https://youtu.be/aCAjbRb1ZNk?t=1124) and not a lot of people in the planet can solve it.

If you can keep your customers, it's impossible not to get rich. It's a superpower.

This might be a strong point in my value proposition.

### Risk Reduction Offer

This is [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OKnv1XEhOc).

When you are selling to cold traffic, a lot of them just aren't down to go for a high ticket commitment and immediately have a subscription type thing.

If you simply allow people the anility to pay one time for a trial period, which is just like a setup for your system, they are way more prone to taking that offer and it's absolutely cooking.

### Risk Reversals

Part of an offer. Money Back Guarantees. 

"I'll do this, and I will make you this much. If I don't get this amount than I'll give you your money back"

Risk reversal is not only for clients, they are for you. You have to perform.

### ROAS

Kyle taught me this [one here](https://youtu.be/XgKwfSlTCY4?t=98).

Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) is a marketing metric that measures a specific ad campaign and how it has impacted revenue.

Tracking ROAS can inform whether digital marketing campaigns are working effectively or if there is room for optimization.

### Roledex

A Rolodex is an old-fashioned desktop organizational system, a contact list stored in a rotating card file.

Daniel gave [an example of an asset](https://youtu.be/deAzlMzvhRU?t=549):

> You now have a Roledex of people you can purchase ads from.

### Sales Process

After cold emailing, if you cannot make sales, you have issues in your sales process.

3 parts: **Setting**, **proposal**, **contracting**.

- **Setting**: Do I even want to work with this person? Understand the right questions to ask, what data you need and what you need to see.

- **Proposal**: What are we going to do together?

- **Contracting**: Actually signing.

Just put the numbers in front of the person to make it make sense.

"You are doing this right now, you want to get to this right here. Here is how we can get you from here to there. You'll make it this much, pay me this much." So just make it a no brainer.

You have to be confident in your ability to deliver results for clients.

You need %100 conviction.

Daniel suggests to operate a ROI calculator.

Here is how Daniel explains:

> "Thanks for getting on this call, obviously you are a business owner you want to see ROI"

> "What I would like to do in this call is to breakdown some numbers together and see what's the probability we can make you a profit here. I don't want to take your money not being able to deliver a return."

Here is how Nick elaborates:

> "Customer wants copyrighter for Youtube ads. But they are a leaking bucket on VSL, showup rate on calls and payment plans. What's the probability that I can get a home run perfect youtube ad right out of gate? It will take 200 ads to get some really good ones. So the ROI is there but you are going to have to wait a time. I would rather work with someone where I can get results in 30 days." This is basically the **setting** stage. 

### Scale

[What's the secret to growing on some platform?](https://youtu.be/Wed3AJSq_cQ?t=385)

> Have valuable things to say and give away the sauce. Simply, have the sauce.

### SDR

A sales development representative (SDR) is a sales professional who manages all top-of-the-funnel activities in the sales cycle. 

Top-of-the-funnel activities include everything that happens before a prospect is ready to make a purchase — from gathering prospect data and educating prospects to qualifying leads and booking meetings.

### Selling a Business

This [banger](https://youtu.be/cLtC6IiGUjI?t=894).

Even if you sold, say you get something like 6 Million, that isn't enough money LOL.

It's going to be a little more than 6 million for to get there.

It's not enough money lol.

### Selling Happens Before Selling

When you exist on internet persistantly, people just think about you as the default.

They are watching, lurking. Not even liking your things so you don't even know.

Because if this, when someone 

### SOP

A standard operating procedure is a set of step-by-step instructions for performing a routine activity.

You make SOPs based on different roles in your team. Daniel loves this - [When they are there it is so nice](https://youtu.be/_ubUWUIHN0I?t=635).

SOPs should be followed the same way every time to guarantee that the organization remains consistent and in compliance with business standards.

SOPs provide the policies, processes and standards needed for an organization to succeed.

They reduce errors, increase efficiency and enhance profitability.

They also make a safe work environment and produce guidelines for how to resolve issues and overcome obstacles.

### Speed and Certainty

Banger [video about positioning](https://youtu.be/4uai8ZqWMmc?t=416).

This is what people care about in offers.

### Testimonials

Alex Hormozi said this.

If you are running a sales team you have to show your testimonials to your sales teams, so they KNOW this works.

### Tonality

While you are selling you need to be extremely confident. They can feel it in your tonality.

### Top Line - Bottom Line

Top line is your total sales (also called **revenue**) and bottom line is the total **profit** (also known as net income or net earnings) you get after subtracting all costs from the top line.

### Top of Mind

Part of Personal Brand.

You want referrals, you need to be top of mind.

To be top of mind, you post content on the internet.

It's that simple.

### UGC

User Generated Content. 

Brands want this type of content to run it as ads or post it in their main profile to get organic reach and get more traffic.

### VSL

A video sales letter (VSL) is a video that pitches a product or service to potential customers.

VSL is **not** debatable.

You can just use your phone and put subtitles.

Outline could be: whats the problem this audience has, how they tried to solve it that has not worked thus far, how is your way different, what's the terms you being able to solve the problem (add social proof too).

This definition sounds like the [CLOSER method](https://www.skool.com/acceleratoruniversity/what-is-alex-hormozis-closer-framework).

To make a good VSL you have to have a good offer.

Another banger.

[VSL's make everything order of magnitude better](https://youtu.be/XgKwfSlTCY4?t=381).

### VA

A virtual assistant.

### Variance

If you are running an agency, there is always going to be variance in your results.

You are going to have down months, better months.

So you need fulfillment to compensate with variance. (See : [Fulfillment](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#fulfillment) - Client Likes You)

### Warm Traffic

Warm traffic consists of people who already know about you, your brand, products or services.

They may have visited your site before.

They've read your content.

### What do people want when they buy?

This [banger](https://youtu.be/aCAjbRb1ZNk?t=5227).

They want to purchase your experience, they don't want a course, they just want it executed right now.

Leveraging your experience.

### Why is Daniel Making videos?

[This banger](https://youtu.be/aCAjbRb1ZNk?t=5883).

I'm not making videos to entertain people.

I'm making videos to convey competence, convey value and sell stuff.

### Year-Over-Year - Y/Y

### Youtube Video

You put 1 Youtube Video you are in %1.
