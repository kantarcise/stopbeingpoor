## The Words

### 90 Day Increments

Daniel banger:

> Everything you want in life is gated between 90 day increments.

### Branding

Are you positioning yourself as the expert on the X topic?

Are people referring to you as the expert on the X topic?

### Claim

Part of an offer. "I'll do this and I will make you this much"

- You can not do this.
- You can do it yourself.
- You get in a time machine and join Client Ascension.

### Cold Email

A cold email is an unsolicited e-mail that is sent to a receiver without prior contact.

Cold email is a demand capture mechanism.

3 parts: Lead gen, craft emails and responding. Everything has to be right: Offer - VSL - Landing Page and the Cold Email Strategy - Your leads. That's when you make a successful business.

Just know this, it takes time. 2 weeks is not enough to measure a cold email campaign. Everyone you cold email has s*** going on in their life. 1 - it's not the right time. 2 - they need to be hit with different angles overtime. Stats are aggregate. You should close 1 person from 1000 mails. But this will happen in a 90 day window.

- Lead gen: [ListKit](https://www.listkit.io/pricing) (ListKit - Only pay for verified lists) is superior to [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) (Credits for List - 40% bounce, you burn your domain - email cleaning - you lose %40 mails you bought), craft emails and responding. You can do a lot of cool stuff in Listkit for filtering.

- Craft Emails: The way you write a cold email will depend on a lot of things. Market sophistication level and who you are emailing. Do we do Loom videos?

- Response Handling: This is just about inbox management. You might get a response to a cold email in 5 months. This is normal. Everyone you email is going to go through their own conversion cycle.

If your offer is bad, you cannot make cold emails work. You need a solid funnel. Your script has to be right. Who you are targeting has to be right. Follow-ups and responses has to be right.

You can use cold email to make a demand capture offer to a demand generation offer in 2 ways:

- Morph the offer with some uniqueness.

- Cold emailing with relevant indicators. (They are hiring specific type of person - they are using a specific type of technology on their website. You scrape lists like that)

### Cold Outreach

Bigger term including Cold Emails.

### Churn

### Deliverable


### Demand Capture Offers

Web Desing! You sell web design to people already looking for websites.

### Demand Generation Offers

A unique twist on a Demand Capture offer. You do websites in a unique way. Example: You do websites that have monitoring software that prevents fraud for e-commerce clients.

You have to position a demand capture offer to a demand generation offer as hard as possible.

### Demand Capture - Demand Generation Scale

You want to find out what your offer sits in this scale. For Demand Capture offers, you'll need more volume.

### Evidence: Part of an offer. Can you actually do the thing you are claiming? It's is critical to aggregate evidence and present it in a correct way.

### Funnel

You can just get [Clickfunnels 2.0](https://www.clickfunnels.com/) Parts are: Headline as offer, VSL, book call, automation (someone books a call you actually get noticed and you now what to say after), [typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) for assessment, [calendly](https://calendly.com/) for calendar.

### Fulfillment

How do you make sure the clients you sign consistently are able to get results, and how do you make sure your business runs smoothly?

2 components two keeping a client.

- Client Results
- Client Experience (no one talks about this which is insane)

If your client does not have a relationship with you they will leave when there is a better claim, which will happen inevitably (see Market Sophistication Level 5)

If your client likes you, they are going to give you more leeway to correct. (See: Variance)

Client Ascension teaches this, you make sure your clients business is working well.

Banger ideas:

- Make automated results.

- Be very transparent with about what's happening.

as a result, people just like you.

Nick added:

> If there is a communication delay and the client does not like you, there is no reason to keep you around.

Daniel adds:

> People keep working with an agency JUST BECAUSE they found the agency as a good person. This actually happens. 

Be a good person:

- Being on time - transparent timelines.
- Be someone who is considerate on their business and their agenda, not just your own.
- Sent gifts.
- We hang out.

and there is incredible opportunity here for more.

### Hiring

How do you hire people to help you in your business?

Problems:

- Not hiring anyone.
- Hiring the wrong people.

### Landing Page

Needs a Youtube Video. Potential Client: "I watched 2 mins of this video, this guy gives value - he knows what he is talking about."

### LTV:

### Market Sophistication

Basically, how many competitors you have. Level 5, maximum amount of competitors - e-commerce email marketing. It's hyper competitive. In 2012 you can go to any e-com brand - "Hey do you need Facebook ads?" that would just sell. No one did it. At Level 1, you basically have no competitors.

### Market Sophistication Level 5

The hardest game. Every single offer will eventually be level 5. Just sophisticate the market yourself, that's what being taught in Client Ascension. This is the best positioning you can stand.

### Offer

You need to do one clear thing, for one clear person, with one clear outcome and one clear risk reversal with one clear evidence that you are able to do that. What you do, who you serve, what the terms are?

### Operations

What do I hire people for? How do I pick people? How do you train people?

You want to offload some work, but in reality your work is more (in the beginning).

Questions:

- How do you make a client management infrastructure?

- How do you track all the things that needs to be done?

- How do you make sure everyone is doing things that they need to do?

- How do you make sure the people you hire actually stay with you and build a company culture.

- How do you get them to go above and beyond?

### Opportunities

If you understand the client needs something else as a priority other than what you offer, you can just use the opportunities channel in slack and find some people to split the revenue.

### Personal Brand

Only way to sell at Market Sophistication Level 5.

You have claim, risk reversal, evidence AND you need to do content marketing that gives upfront value. If you do not do this, when market sophisticates, business will die.

What do I make content on?

- Giving value. You are showing people how to facilitate. What is is that you do?

- They could do it themselves theocratically, however, you are selling to business owners. When they consume this value based content, they are not thinking "I'm going to do this myself" it's like vetting for you, "let me see this guys process".

It just shows competence.

You become the default of it. ***Become the default man.***

Daniel banger:

> Who else will do a webflow series, unless you are a webflow expert.

It's **the association**. You have to be an expert if you post a video on Youtube because every other expert does post a video on Youtube.  

> "Only experts gon on podcasts, so if you are on a podcast, you have to be an expert." That's the thinking pattern.

### Response from Cold Email

If someone is going to reply to your cold email, they will %100 Google you.

### Risk Reversals

Part of an offer. Money Back Guarantees. "I'll do this, and I will make you this much. If I don't get this amount than I'll give you your money back"

Risk reversal is not only for clients, they are for you. You have to perform.

### Sales Process

After cold emailing, if you cannot make sales, you have issues in your sales process.

3 parts: Setting, closing, contracting.

- Setting: Do I even want to work with this person? Understand the right questions to ask, what data you need and what you need to see.

- Proposal: What are we 

- Contracting:

Just put the numbers in front of the person to make it make sense.

You are doing this right now, you want to get to this right here. Here is how we can get you from here to there. You'll make it this much, pay me this much. Just make it no brainer.

You have to be confident in your ability to deliver results for clients.

You need %100 conviction.

Operate a ROI calculator.

Here is how Daniel explains:

> "Thanks for getting on this call, obviously you are a business owner you want to see ROI"

> "What I would like to do in this call is to breakdown some numbers together and see what's the probability we can make you a profit here. I don't want to take your money not being able to deliver a return."

Here is how Nick elaborates

> "Customer wants copyrighter for Youtube ads. You are a leaking bucket on your VSL, showup rate on calls and your payment plans. What's the probability that I can get a home run perfect youtube ad right out of gate? It will take 200 ads to get some really good ones. So the ROI is there but you are going to have to wait a time. I would rather work with someone where I can get results in 30 days. I asked for the numbers."

### Testimonials

Alex Hormozi said this. If you are running a sales team you have to show your testimonials to your sales teams, so they KNOW this works.

### Tonality

While you are selling you need to be extremely confident. They can feel it in your tonality.

### Top of Mind

Part of Personal Brand. You want referrals, you need to be top of mind. TO be top of mind, you post content on the internet.

### VSL

A video sales letter (VSL) is a video that pitches a product or service to potential customers. VSL is not debatable. You can just use your phone and put subtitles. Outline could be: whats the problem this audience has, how they tried to solve it that has not worked thus far, how is your way different, what's the terms you being able to solve the problem (add social proof too). This definition sounds like the [CLOSER method](https://www.skool.com/acceleratoruniversity/what-is-alex-hormozis-closer-framework). To make a good VSL you have to have a good offer.

### VA

A virtual assistant.

### Variance

If you are running an agency, there is always going to be variance in your results. You are going to have down months, better months.


### Youtube Video

You put 1 Youtube Video you are in %1.
