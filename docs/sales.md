# Sales

## Sales from the Glossary

After cold emailing, if you cannot make sales, you have issues in your sales process.

3 parts: **Setting**, **proposal**, **contracting**.

- **Setting**: Do I even want to work with this person? Understand the right questions to ask, what data you need and what you need to see.

- **Proposal**: What are we going to do together?

- **Contracting**: Actually signing.

Just put the numbers in front of the person to make it make sense.

"You are doing this right now, you want to get to this right here. Here is how we can get you from here to there. You'll make it this much, pay me this much." So just make it a no brainer.

You have to be confident in your ability to deliver results for clients.

You need %100 conviction.

Daniel suggests to operate a ROI calculator.

Here is how Daniel explains:

> "Thanks for getting on this call, obviously you are a business owner you want to see ROI"

> "What I would like to do in this call is to breakdown some numbers together and see what's the probability we can make you a profit here. I don't want to take your money not being able to deliver a return."

Here is how Nick elaborates:

> "Customer wants copyrighter for Youtube ads. But they are a leaking bucket on VSL, showup rate on calls and payment plans. What's the probability that I can get a home run perfect youtube ad right out of gate? It will take 200 ads to get some really good ones. So the ROI is there but you are going to have to wait a time. I would rather work with someone where I can get results in 30 days." This is basically the **setting** stage. 

## Signing New Clients

[The 3 Reasons You Arenâ€™t Signing New Clients (Fix This NOW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpNFNverylM) - 3 September 2022

If you are selling a service and you are not getting any clients here is why 

### Not Getting Leads

People can't buy from you if they do not know you exist.

%80 of the business is making people find out about you.

In digital realm there's 2 ways to do this:

1. Outbound Marketing
2. Inbound Marketing

Outbound consists of:

- Sending cold emails
- Sending cold DMs
- Making cold calls

Inbound consists of:

- Posting Content on Social
- Appearing on other people's social media
- Advertising

### Selling Something People Don't Want to Buy

You personally might think that your idea is good, that does not mean people actually want to buy it.

Do not sell something unless people are already buying it.

I repeat:

> Do not sell something unless people are already buying it.

You are not trying to make the next billion startup, you are trying to make $30k/mo.

The demand needs to be proven.

Someone already is doing it.

What's selling already?

You watch ads on social to discover. Watch their videos. See what they are offering.

If you see an ad 30 times, it's working.

!!! tip

    What about saturation?

    Saturation doesn't exits.

    Market sophistication exists.

    Here is explanation by Eugene Schwartz

#### Levels of Market Sophistication

**Level 1**: The product or service is completely new. "We'll run your facebook ads for you"

**Level 2**: Out Doing the competition. "More people have entered the market. Your claims have to be better with proof".

**Level 3**: Showing Customer How It Works. "The claims have become too exaggerated. You now have to show them exactly how it works as a sales tactic. Introduce more mechanisms".

**Level 4**: The Cold War. "Yours has to be faster and cheaper"

**Level 5**: Story Telling. "You get people to buy buying from You instead of buying the THING, you build a personal brand".

Just go straight to the bottom!

### You don't exist on internet

Here is typically what happens with a new guy who wants to get into business and cut corners.

1. He comes up with a service (facebook ads)
2. He starts sending cold emails
3. It doesn't work
4. He gives up and writes it all off as a scam

The real reason is:

1. He is trying to sell something with Sophistication Level 5
2. When people do get his emails, he didn't realize what happened:

- He doesn't have a website

- If he does have a website, he doesn't have a video of himself on it.

- He has no social media presence or anything that conveys authority

- He has no social proof in terms of followers

- He has no value posts, no guides, no videos, no case studies

He simply raw dogged cold emails out.

When the prospect went to investigate who this guy was on the internet nothing showed up.

So they ignored the email (scam or an absolute beginner).

### What if you want to scale ?

What do you do?

1. You need a good offer that is in demand right now, and you need to **structure it** so that you can charge at least $3000 for it.

2. You need a VSL. Why should people use your thing?

3. You need to send cold emails for your first 5-10 clients. A lot of COLD emails.

4. You need to get better at sales. You need to know how to speak to other humans and convince them why they should pay you.

5. You need to learn how to hire, automate, delegate and you need to know when to do it and what to have them do.

### Do More of Everything

This is a loop.

Lead gen is 20% content and 80% proof.

If you do not have proof yet, you need to go extremely hard on content and outbound to generate %80 in the first place.
