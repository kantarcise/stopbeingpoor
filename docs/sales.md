# Sales

## Sales from the Glossary

After cold emailing, if you cannot make sales, you have issues in your sales process.

3 parts: **Setting**, **proposal**, **contracting**.

- **Setting**: Do I even want to work with this person? Understand the right questions to ask, what data you need and what you need to see.

- **Proposal**: What are we going to do together?

- **Contracting**: Actually signing.

Just put the numbers in front of the person to make it make sense.

"You are doing this right now, you want to get to this right here. Here is how we can get you from here to there. You'll make it this much, pay me this much." So just make it a no brainer.

You have to be confident in your ability to deliver results for clients.

You need %100 conviction.

Daniel suggests to operate a ROI calculator.

Here is how Daniel explains:

> "Thanks for getting on this call, obviously you are a business owner you want to see ROI"

> "What I would like to do in this call is to breakdown some numbers together and see what's the probability we can make you a profit here. I don't want to take your money not being able to deliver a return."

Here is how Nick elaborates:

> "Customer wants copyrighter for Youtube ads. But they are a leaking bucket on VSL, showup rate on calls and payment plans. What's the probability that I can get a home run perfect youtube ad right out of gate? It will take 200 ads to get some really good ones. So the ROI is there but you are going to have to wait a time. I would rather work with someone where I can get results in 30 days." This is basically the **setting** stage. 

## Signing New Clients

[The 3 Reasons You Aren’t Signing New Clients (Fix This NOW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpNFNverylM) - 3 September 2022

If you are selling a service and you are not getting any clients here is why 

### Not Getting Leads

People can't buy from you if they do not know you exist.

%80 of the business is making people find out about you.

In digital realm there's 2 ways to do this:

1. Outbound Marketing
2. Inbound Marketing

Outbound consists of:

- Sending cold emails
- Sending cold DMs
- Making cold calls

Inbound consists of:

- Posting Content on Social
- Appearing on other people's social media
- Advertising

### Selling Something People Don't Want to Buy

You personally might think that your idea is good, that does not mean people actually want to buy it.

Do not sell something unless people are already buying it.

I repeat:

> Do not sell something unless people are already buying it.

You are not trying to make the next billion startup, you are trying to make $30k/mo.

The demand needs to be proven.

Someone already is doing it.

What's selling already?

You watch ads on social to discover. Watch their videos. See what they are offering.

If you see an ad 30 times, it's working.

!!! tip

    What about saturation?

    Saturation doesn't exits.

    Market sophistication exists.

    Here is explanation by Eugene Schwartz - book is [Breakthrough Advertising](https://www.amazon.com/Breakthrough-Advertising-Eugene-M-Schwartz/dp/0887232981)

#### Levels of Market Sophistication

**Level 1**: The product or service is completely new. "We'll run your facebook ads for you"

**Level 2**: Out Doing the competition. "More people have entered the market. Your claims have to be better with proof".

**Level 3**: Showing Customer How It Works. "The claims have become too exaggerated. You now have to show them exactly how it works as a sales tactic. Introduce more mechanisms".

**Level 4**: The Cold War. "Yours has to be faster and cheaper"

**Level 5**: Story Telling. "You get people to buy buying from You instead of buying the THING, you build a personal brand".

Just go straight to the bottom!

### You don't exist on internet

Here is typically what happens with a new guy who wants to get into business and cut corners.

1. He comes up with a service (facebook ads)
2. He starts sending cold emails
3. It doesn't work
4. He gives up and writes it all off as a scam

The real reason is:

1. He is trying to sell something with Sophistication Level 5
2. When people do get his emails, he didn't realize what happened:

- He doesn't have a website

- If he does have a website, he doesn't have a video of himself on it.

- He has no social media presence or anything that conveys authority

- He has no social proof in terms of followers

- He has no value posts, no guides, no videos, no case studies

He simply raw dogged cold emails out.

When the prospect went to investigate who this guy was on the internet nothing showed up.

So they ignored the email (scam or an absolute beginner).

### What if you want to scale ?

What do you do?

1. You need a good offer that is in demand right now, and you need to **structure it** so that you can charge at least $3000 for it.

2. You need a VSL. Why should people use your thing?

3. You need to send cold emails for your first 5-10 clients. A lot of COLD emails.

4. You need to get better at sales. You need to know how to speak to other humans and convince them why they should pay you.

5. You need to learn how to hire, automate, delegate and you need to know when to do it and what to have them do.

### Do More of Everything

This is a loop.

Lead gen is 20% content and 80% proof.

If you do not have proof yet, you need to go extremely hard on content and outbound to generate %80 in the first place.

[How Dylan Scaled His Agency to $41k/mo in 7 months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR5rxXycrV8) - 5 September 2022

## Interview Transcript: Dylan Rich - Cold Calling Agency Success

**Daniel:** What's up everybody! I got Dylan Rich here. He's running a $41k/mo agency right now. You've been in Client Ascension for about seven months. I wanted to do this interview—just introduce yourself to everyone, what you do, and how things are going.

**Dylan:** Thank you, Daniel. My name is Dylan Rich. We help SaaS and software companies build predictable sales systems using cold email, cold calling, LinkedIn strategies—a full business development team in a box for small to mid-level SaaS companies.

**Daniel:** And you're basically placing SDRs into businesses, creating the playbook, writing scripts, finding contacts, integrating with CRMs—top to bottom.

**Dylan:** Exactly. Sales systems in a box.

**Daniel:** When did you start this business? Walk us through the journey of the past seven months.

**Dylan:** I used to work a 9–5 in sales. I knew my knowledge could yield more revenue if I went out on my own. I quit in December of last year and have been full-time since. The big revenue jump came from listening to clients—we added cold calling services. We also launched a separate SDR training and placement company. We help companies *and* people wanting to earn remotely. **So everyone wins**.

**Daniel:** You're the cold calling guy.

**Dylan:** Yeah, I used to make 200–250 dials a day for over a year. We teach a lot of mindset because it’s a grind.

**Daniel:** If someone just says, “Hey Dylan, I want a cold caller in my business,” you can place and train them?

**Dylan:** Yes. We have two models: strict placement with a guarantee, and outsourced SDRs managed by us. Clients just get meetings.

**Daniel:** So it's like a lead gen agency but with a different mechanism. Most people start a cold email agency, but staying ahead means doing the hard things like cold calling.

**Dylan:** Exactly. **Everyone knows cold calling works, but it’s hard to hire, train, and retain SDRs.** The half-life of an SDR is six to seven months.

**Daniel:** You're the cold calling coach inside Client Ascension now.

**Dylan:** Yeah, because it's effective. Cold calls let you uncover objections you’d never find in email.

**Daniel:** Did you think you'd hit $41k/month in seven months?

**Dylan:** I believed in doing the right things consistently. I didn’t focus on a number, just discipline and detachment from instant gratification.

**Daniel:** Did you hit a wall at 10k or 20k?

**Dylan:** Definitely. Sometimes the offer isn’t scalable (from fulfillment perspective) or you’re charging too little. You must pivot fast. Getting from 10k to 25k to 50k requires better fulfillment, systems, hiring, and retention.

**Daniel:** Retention is key. Churn kills scalability.

**Dylan:** Exactly. You can’t grow if everyone’s churning. It’s like decorating a burning house.

**Daniel:** If you're running an agency doing \$5–10k/month and want to scale to \$500k–\$1M/year, go to [clientascension.com](http://clientascension.com). Now, back to the video.

**Daniel:** If you're selling \$2k–\$3k services and clients stay only 3 months, it’s hard to scale. You need to sell \$5k–\$10k packages. That ties into doing hard things like cold calling.

**Dylan:** Yeah. People jump into over saturated business models like short-form content. It’ll get competitive. We saw that and pivoted early.

**Daniel:** How do you acquire clients? Cold outbound? Twitter? LinkedIn?

**Dylan:** The same systems we sell—we use. Cold calls, outbound, Twitter, LinkedIn, referrals. If someone gets a call from us selling cold calls, it proves the method works. Twitter builds personal brand and credibility. Referrals come from every conversation.

**Daniel:** And I’ve referred people to you! How far can you scale this?

**Dylan:** Fulfillment is our constraint, not marketing. We focus on training SDRs and growing the pool of appointment setters. It comes in cycles: onboard clients → fulfill → grow team → repeat.

**Daniel:** I love businesses in two lanes: high-ticket B2B or mass market biz ops. But biz ops get diluted fast.

**Dylan:** Yep. Teaching everyone how to do what you do just saturates the market. You need brand awareness, authority, and a personal brand to stay competitive.

**Daniel:** People fear committing to a personal brand. Ironically, it gives flexibility to pivot.

**Dylan:** 100%. Daily effort builds credibility. Even one tweet is better than none.

**Daniel:** If someone’s doing $5k/month and wants to hit $41k/month, what would you tell them?

**Dylan:** Focus. Niche down hard. Stop taking on anyone who’s just interested. Pick one offer, one client type, master it. Don’t be okay at three things—be great at one. Do that for 3–4 months, then reevaluate. Also, focus on controllable inputs daily. Break goals into daily actions. That builds momentum.

**Daniel:** What’s your experience been like inside Client Ascension?

**Dylan:** Amazing. I’ve built close bonds with smart people across operations, copywriting, lead gen, and more. Real friendships, great feedback, and support.

**Daniel:** Tons of camaraderie.

**Dylan:** Yup. If you’re down one day, someone in there just closed a 10k deal. Lots of members doing over \$100k/month. You can DM them and learn directly.

**Daniel:** Where will you be in six months?

**Dylan:** Targeting $125k–$150k/month. We’re not changing the offer—just getting better and faster at fulfilling it.

**Daniel:** That’s what people need to hear. One offer. One association. Cold calling = Dylan. Cold email = me. SEO = Kaval. That clarity creates breakthroughs.

**Dylan:** You need to be willing to suck for a while. Sales was one thing—I had to learn fulfillment too. But I kept showing up.

**Daniel:** Thanks for coming on, brother. All of Dylan’s links are below. And if you want to join Client Ascension, come hang out with us.

**Dylan:** Appreciate it, man.
