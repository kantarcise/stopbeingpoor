# Sales

## Sales from the Glossary

After cold emailing, if you cannot make sales, you have issues in your sales process.

3 parts: **Setting**, **proposal**, **contracting**.

- **Setting**: Do I even want to work with this person? Understand the right questions to ask, what data you need and what you need to see.

- **Proposal**: What are we going to do together?

- **Contracting**: Actually signing.

Just put the numbers in front of the person to make it make sense.

"You are doing this right now, you want to get to this right here. Here is how we can get you from here to there. You'll make it this much, pay me this much." So just make it a no brainer.

You have to be confident in your ability to deliver results for clients.

You need %100 conviction.

Daniel suggests to operate a ROI calculator.

Here is how Daniel explains:

> "Thanks for getting on this call, obviously you are a business owner you want to see ROI"

> "What I would like to do in this call is to breakdown some numbers together and see what's the probability we can make you a profit here. I don't want to take your money not being able to deliver a return."

Here is how Nick elaborates:

> "Customer wants copyrighter for Youtube ads. But they are a leaking bucket on VSL, showup rate on calls and payment plans. What's the probability that I can get a home run perfect youtube ad right out of gate? It will take 200 ads to get some really good ones. So the ROI is there but you are going to have to wait a time. I would rather work with someone where I can get results in 30 days." This is basically the **setting** stage.
