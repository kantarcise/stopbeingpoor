# Fulfillment

## Fulfillment from the Glossary

How do you make sure the clients you sign consistently are able to get results, and how do you make sure your business runs smoothly?

2 components two keeping a client.

- Client Results (see: [Claim](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#claim))
- Client Experience (no one talks about this which is **insane**)

If your client does not have a relationship with you they will leave when there is a better claim, which will happen inevitably (see [Market Sophistication Level 5](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#market-sophistication-level-5)).

If your client likes you, they are going to give you more leeway to correct. (See: [Variance](https://internatclientascension.kantarcise.com/glossary/#variance))

Client Ascension teaches this, you make sure your clients business is working well.

Banger ideas:

- Make automated results.

- Be very transparent with about what's happening.

as a result, people just like you.

Nick added:

> If there is a communication delay and the client does not like you, there is no reason to keep you around.

Daniel adds:

> People keep working with an agency JUST BECAUSE they found the agency as a good person. This actually happens. 

Be a good person:

- Being on time - transparent timelines.
- Be someone who is considerate on their business and their agenda, not just your own.
- Sent gifts.
- We hang out.

and there is incredible opportunity here for more.
