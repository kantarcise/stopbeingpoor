# Cold Email

## Cold Email from the Glossary

A cold email is an unsolicited e-mail that is sent to a receiver without prior contact.

Cold email is a demand capture mechanism.

3 parts: **Lead gen**, **craft emails** and **responding**.

Everything has to be right: Offer - VSL - Landing Page and the Cold Email Strategy - Your leads. That's when you make a successful business.

Just know this, it takes time. 2 weeks is not enough to measure a cold email campaign. Everyone you cold email has s*** going on in their life. 1 - it's not the right time. 2 - they need to be hit with different angles overtime.

So stats are aggregated. You should close 1 person from 1000 mails. But this will happen in a 90 day window.

- **Lead gen**: [ListKit](https://www.listkit.io/pricing) (ListKit - Only pay for verified lists) is superior to [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) (Credits for List - 40% bounce, you burn your domain - email cleaning - you lose %40 mails you bought), craft emails and responding. You can do a lot of cool stuff in Listkit for filtering.

- **Craft Emails**: The way you write a cold email will depend on a lot of things. Market sophistication level and who you are emailing. Do we do Loom videos?

- **Response Handling**: This is just about inbox management. You might get a response to a cold email in 5 months. This is normal. Everyone you email is going to go through their own conversion cycle.

If your offer is bad, you cannot make cold emails work. You need a solid funnel. Your script has to be right. Who you are targeting has to be right. Follow-ups and responses has to be right.

You can use cold email to make a demand capture offer to a demand generation offer in 2 ways:

- Morph the offer with some uniqueness.

- Cold emailing with relevant indicators. (They are hiring specific type of person - they are using a specific type of technology on their website. You scrape lists like that)

[Cold Email Vs. Cold Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnkSEz8OwY) - 11 November 2022

It's way easier to cold email.

**Cold Calling:**

  * More personal, higher conversion rate
  * Requires more energy and ongoing training
  * Works well when strategically used in tandem with cold email
  * Great for following up with contacts who opened but didn’t reply

**Cold Email:**

  * Easier to scale
  * Lower barrier to entry (scripts + domains = instant launch)
  * More predictable, but less personal

  * You can be like, I already made this good script to this specific niche from this specific lead list. Just rail up 10 domains and go.

The people who will answer cold calls and cold emails are different, so you need to be doing both.

> **Takeaway**: Best results come from **integrating both** channels simultaneously.

### Improving Lead Follow-Up

* Many quality leads open cold emails but never reply
* These can be followed up with via phone call
* Salespeople should avoid getting too deep in the weeds on a cold call

  * Don’t answer all questions
  * Defer complex answers to demo calls

> **Frame the conversation** and **control the flow** to maintain authority.

### Personal Sales Outreach Neglected

* With strong marketing channels (like Twitter), it’s easy to neglect 1-on-1 outreach
* New followers are not being personally contacted
* More direct messaging and interaction is needed in DMs and other platforms

### Sales Integration with Marketing

* Aim: Integrate Sales Systems **into** existing Marketing

  * Leverage marketing reach to guide users into personalized sales cycles
  * Addressing this gap could unlock massive potential

> Example: Use automated systems to detect opt-ins and instantly trigger personalized follow-ups

### Cold Offers Must Be Designed for Cold Traffic

* You can’t just run cold outreach on a service or offer that isn’t cold-conversion-ready
* **Client Ascension** is structured and positioned to work with **pure cold traffic**.

> Agencies usually convert easier cold, but coaching/consulting must be **engineered** for it

### Hunting Outside Your Watering Hole

* Twitter is a powerful channel, but it’s only one platform
* Cold calling, DMing, and YouTube allow you to **hunt in other watering holes**
* Broaden outreach beyond comfort zone

### Client Ascension Insights

* Teaching both cold email and cold calling
* SDRs or founders can benefit from structured sales coaching
* Dedicated coaches available for each track

> **Sales + Marketing Synergy** is the long-term strategy

### Closing Notes

* Cold calling still underused despite massive effectiveness
* Coaching and strategy can close the gap
* Real success comes from full-stack outbound: email, calling, social outreach, plus optimized cold-ready offers
