# Cold Email

## Cold Email from the Glossary

A cold email is an unsolicited e-mail that is sent to a receiver without prior contact.

Cold email is a demand capture mechanism.

3 parts: **Lead gen**, **craft emails** and **responding**.

Everything has to be right: Offer - VSL - Landing Page and the Cold Email Strategy - Your leads. That's when you make a successful business.

Just know this, it takes time. 2 weeks is not enough to measure a cold email campaign. Everyone you cold email has s*** going on in their life. 1 - it's not the right time. 2 - they need to be hit with different angles overtime.

So stats are aggregated. You should close 1 person from 1000 mails. But this will happen in a 90 day window.

- **Lead gen**: [ListKit](https://www.listkit.io/pricing) (ListKit - Only pay for verified lists) is superior to [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) (Credits for List - 40% bounce, you burn your domain - email cleaning - you lose %40 mails you bought), craft emails and responding. You can do a lot of cool stuff in Listkit for filtering.

- **Craft Emails**: The way you write a cold email will depend on a lot of things. Market sophistication level and who you are emailing. Do we do Loom videos?

- **Response Handling**: This is just about inbox management. You might get a response to a cold email in 5 months. This is normal. Everyone you email is going to go through their own conversion cycle.

If your offer is bad, you cannot make cold emails work. You need a solid funnel. Your script has to be right. Who you are targeting has to be right. Follow-ups and responses has to be right.

You can use cold email to make a demand capture offer to a demand generation offer in 2 ways:

- Morph the offer with some uniqueness.

- Cold emailing with relevant indicators. (They are hiring specific type of person - they are using a specific type of technology on their website. You scrape lists like that)

## Cold Email Vs. Cold Calling

[Cold Email Vs. Cold Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnkSEz8OwY) - 11 November 2022

It's way easier to cold email.

**Cold Calling:**

  * More personal, higher conversion rate
  * Requires more energy and ongoing training
  * Works well when strategically used in tandem with cold email
  * Great for following up with contacts who opened but didn’t reply

**Cold Email:**

  * Easier to scale
  * Lower barrier to entry (scripts + domains = instant launch)
  * More predictable, but less personal

  * You can be like, I already made this good script to this specific niche from this specific lead list. Just rail up 10 domains and go.

The people who will answer cold calls and cold emails are different, so you need to be doing both.

> **Takeaway**: Best results come from **integrating both** channels simultaneously.

### Improving Lead Follow-Up

* Many quality leads open cold emails but never reply
* These can be followed up with via phone call
* Salespeople should avoid getting too deep in the weeds on a cold call

  * Don’t answer all questions
  * Defer complex answers to demo calls

> **Frame the conversation** and **control the flow** to maintain authority.

### Personal Sales Outreach Neglected

* With strong marketing channels (like Twitter), it’s easy to neglect 1-on-1 outreach
* New followers are not being personally contacted
* More direct messaging and interaction is needed in DMs and other platforms

### Sales Integration with Marketing

* Aim: Integrate Sales Systems **into** existing Marketing

  * Leverage marketing reach to guide users into personalized sales cycles
  * Addressing this gap could unlock massive potential

> Example: Use automated systems to detect opt-ins and instantly trigger personalized follow-ups

### Cold Offers Must Be Designed for Cold Traffic

* You can’t just run cold outreach on a service or offer that isn’t cold-conversion-ready
* **Client Ascension** is structured and positioned to work with **pure cold traffic**.

> Agencies usually convert easier cold, but coaching/consulting must be **engineered** for it

### Hunting Outside Your Watering Hole

* Twitter is a powerful channel, but it’s only one platform
* Cold calling, DMing, and YouTube allow you to **hunt in other watering holes**
* Broaden outreach beyond comfort zone

### Client Ascension Insights

* Teaching both cold email and cold calling
* SDRs or founders can benefit from structured sales coaching
* Dedicated coaches available for each track

> **Sales + Marketing Synergy** is the long-term strategy

### Closing Notes

* Cold calling still underused despite massive effectiveness
* Coaching and strategy can close the gap
* Real success comes from full-stack outbound: email, calling, social outreach, plus optimized cold-ready offers

## How To Get Sales from Cold

[How To ACTUALLY Turn Cold DM’s & Cold Emails Into Sales (stop getting ghosted)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a76Y8q5EBqY) - 1 February 2023

Here’s your fully formatted version of the transcript with proper structure, `###` level headings, and **no timestamps**, in the same style as previous responses. Host is **Daniel**:

### Why Your Cold DMs and Cold Emails Aren’t Working

I want to make a quick rant on everybody sending cold DMs and cold emails.

You might think you have a good offer — yet you’re wondering: **Why isn’t anyone responding? Why are my DMs and emails being ignored?**

Let’s break this down and get to the real reason.

### “People With Lots of Followers Don’t Check Their DMs” — Wrong

People say that large accounts don’t check their DMs. That’s **not true**.

I have over 111,000 followers on Twitter, and I look at **every single DM**.

If I get a cold pitch, I — and everyone else — do the same thing:

We **click on your profile** before responding.

I repeat.

> We **click on your profile** before responding.

### What’s On Your Profile Determines Everything

Let’s assume your cold DM says something like:

> “Hey \[Name], \[compliment]. Would you be interested in \[X]?”

The recipient immediately clicks on your **profile** before replying.

Now ask yourself:

* **Does your bio say what you do?**
* **Is there clear social proof?**
* **Is your offer described?**
* **Is there a link to a landing page or website?**

That’s what people look at.

Your **bio** sells the **click** to your landing page.

And your **landing page** — that's what does all the selling.

### What Should Be On Your Landing Page

Once someone clicks through, you must clearly present:

* A **video sales letter (VSL)**
* A **clear value proposition**
* **Proof** or a **guarantee**
* **Pain points** that you’re solving
* **A real problem** that actually exists
* A reason to **book or buy** right now

!!! tip

    This is basically an offer video now.

    Once someone clicks through, you must clearly present:

    - A **video sales letter (VSL)**
    
    - A **clear value proposition**
    
    - **Proof** or a **guarantee**
    
    - **Pain points** that you’re solving
    
    - **A real problem** that actually exists
    
    - A reason to **book or buy** right now

Most of you think the **copy** in your cold message is what matters most.

But it’s not. It’s **what’s behind the click** that makes or breaks it.

If your landing page is well-structured and hits real pain points, people won’t even reply — they’ll **just book**. 

Sometimes they’ll even **buy without saying a word**.

### Don’t “Build Rapport” — Make the Offer Obvious

People don’t want to chit-chat in the DMs.

They don’t want your 3-message rapport-building sequence.

They just want to know:

* **Can you solve my problem?**
* **Do you know what you’re doing?**
* **Is this better than what I’ve tried before?**

Your **profile** and **sales page** should answer all of those instantly.

That’s what does the selling.

Your **cold DM is just the traffic source** — not the conversion engine.

### The Same Applies to Cold Emails

Even if you **don’t include a link** in your cold email (to preserve deliverability), people will still:

* See your `name@company.com`
* Google or visit `company.com`

If that domain leads to **nothing** (404 error, parked page), you’ve already lost them.

But if it leads to:

* A real website
* A good VSL
* A strong value proposition
* Social proof
* Evidence it works
* A guarantee

Then your cold email script doesn’t need to be perfect — because the **offer sells itself**.
 
### Split Testing Scripts Won’t Save a Bad Offer

You can run **50 split tests** on a cold DM script. You can test **subject lines** all day.

None of that matters if:

* Your **offer sucks**
* Your **sales page sucks**
* You **don’t know the pain points**
* You **don’t present the value clearly**

Here’s the truth:

> The **same exact cold script** will perform **10x better** for the person who has a decent landing page and a proper setup than for someone who doesn’t.

### If You Want Help Building a System That Works

If you're a **marketing agency** or a **B2B company**, and you want help:

* Building a **real client acquisition system**
* Designing a **strong offer**
* Setting up a **page that actually sells**

We will **build one for you**. We **guarantee** that you add **a minimum of \$10K/month** in new revenue — or you don’t pay.
