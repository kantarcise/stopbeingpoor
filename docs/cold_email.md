# Cold Email

## Cold Email from the Glossary

A cold email is an unsolicited e-mail that is sent to a receiver without prior contact.

Cold email is a demand capture mechanism.

3 parts: **Lead gen**, **craft emails** and **responding**.

Everything has to be right: Offer - VSL - Landing Page and the Cold Email Strategy - Your leads. That's when you make a successful business.

Just know this, it takes time. 2 weeks is not enough to measure a cold email campaign. Everyone you cold email has s*** going on in their life. 1 - it's not the right time. 2 - they need to be hit with different angles overtime.

So stats are aggregated. You should close 1 person from 1000 mails. But this will happen in a 90 day window.

- **Lead gen**: [ListKit](https://www.listkit.io/pricing) (ListKit - Only pay for verified lists) is superior to [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) (Credits for List - 40% bounce, you burn your domain - email cleaning - you lose %40 mails you bought), craft emails and responding. You can do a lot of cool stuff in Listkit for filtering.

- **Craft Emails**: The way you write a cold email will depend on a lot of things. Market sophistication level and who you are emailing. Do we do Loom videos?

- **Response Handling**: This is just about inbox management. You might get a response to a cold email in 5 months. This is normal. Everyone you email is going to go through their own conversion cycle.

If your offer is bad, you cannot make cold emails work. You need a solid funnel. Your script has to be right. Who you are targeting has to be right. Follow-ups and responses has to be right.

You can use cold email to make a demand capture offer to a demand generation offer in 2 ways:

- Morph the offer with some uniqueness.

- Cold emailing with relevant indicators. (They are hiring specific type of person - they are using a specific type of technology on their website. You scrape lists like that)
