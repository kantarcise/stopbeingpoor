00:00:00	Mr Daniel Fazio I'm uh I have the pleasure of sitting in your apartment and interviewing you in Tampa Florida um super excited about this podcast this kind of interview and just journeying through your life and through your business and other businesses um I guess just like opening up uh I would love to hear like the elevator pitch of your business journey to where you are now yeah so um I graduated Florida State in 2018 with a degree in finance and the very last week of college I mean the very last week I was in there I saw this

00:00:37	video that said how to make ten thousand dollars per month with Amazon FBA and I was like oh wow I want to make ten thousand dollars per month so I watched the guys videos and I was always like really hard worker in school I always got really good grades so I just treated it as if it was another class like oh I'm gonna have a test at the end of this except it's like the actual execution of the thing I've been told in life yeah so I watched every single video he had within like a 24-hour span and I don't know maybe it

00:01:07	was like 10 hours of videos or something like that and I started doing the product research like four days later I'm at the bank wiring six thousand dollars over to China to buy to buy I worked in college so I saved a bunch of money I was like yeah I'm just gonna risk it all I don't care like we're gonna see what happens um it comes in like three weeks later I shifted into air it goes into the Amazon warehouse and I sold the [ __ ] out of those products but it was it wasn't because I was smart it was because I caught something at a

00:01:43	very very specific time it turned out it was a seasonal product specifically on Father's Day and it was May and it was about to be Father's Day and it got there just before Father's Day and that thing cooked it was stainless steel beer bottle insulators and I made it was like seven or eight thousand dollars profit and from the moment it went live within like 10 days all of it was sold out and then what happened was I was like yo this is crazy any more inventory anyway more so I bought like double the amount

00:02:15	and Father's day was over at this point I ended up like I didn't lose money on it but I definitely did not make a lot and took a really long time to return capital on it I ended up buying a bunch of other products but that kind of set my journey off into I'd always like sold stuff in in was entrepreneurial as a kid but it set my journey off into the scale to which you could have something because I look at that and I'm like oh like seven thousand dollars profit in 10 days I'm like if I can just consistently

00:02:42	get something like this I don't have to work a job which I just absolutely hated doing I worked at Publix as a cashier and a bagger I hated customer service I worked at Apple I did customer support for Apple I hated customer service I hated I was really good at it though I was always I'm really good at customer service I just did not enjoy being in one single spot doing the same thing for eight consecutive hours and feeling like I had to ask to go to the bathroom or something like that and being like

00:03:11	watched over I just didn't like that so even now to this day I don't like watch over my employees you know what I mean like I kind of just give them the freedom to do it I'm just what I kind of tell them though is just get your stuff done and like actually perform so this was this was always really annoying to me when I worked at Apple there was an average call time and it was about 19 minutes so the average time you would be on the phone with a customer two issue resolution was about 19 minutes

00:03:39	I just knew how to solve the problems so mine was about 13 minutes and you also have an issue resolution rate and it should be around like 90 mine was 95 so I was solving more issues than the average person and doing it faster but you were getting paid the same yeah one I was getting paid the same and two I had a performance review and the and you could get a range like a raise and a range somewhere and these my manager told me she goes you need to spend more time on the phone with the customers it feels like you're rushing

00:04:14	them and I was like are you kidding me I'm doing that output of two people at a higher quality and have above average feedback scores because you'd get like a survey like how was your experience yeah completely positive like did you solve the issue yeah he was great it was just this arbitrary thing they made up and it was like how do you not understand like by every conceivable metric I am way more efficient than any other person and one you're punishing me for it and two in my own mind I know I'm not getting

00:04:49	paid for the more efficient output yeah so you look at these numbers and it's like well if I just owned the entity myself if I'm better than everyone else I want to be compensated in direct proportion to precisely how much better I am yeah and it was just always annoying me and there was always situations like even like public so people love me up at Publix I just hated that concept of not having control over the outcome based on my inputs but I want I wanted something that that that compensated me directly for my inputs

00:05:20	right um so I did the Amazon FBA stuff and real quick on the Amazon IPA stuff do you feel like um you know because I think this is like a common thing for probably a lot of people just in like 20 20 21 where they got into business and everything was kind of just easier right you initially you started out you caught this first Trend do you think that's set um uh an expectation I'm not gonna say unrealistic but set an expectation in your head that was different than you would have preferred looking back on it

00:05:50	or are you glad that it happened like that because I know like you know a lot of people 2021 especially like Traders right the market was just going up so a lot of people were able to make a lot of money and then a lot of those people lost a lot of that money because it set like an unrealistic expectation of what trading actually was yeah so this is this is what's gonna happen most people are gonna be introduced to the world of business through some kind of business opportunity right so it just so happened

00:06:13	that my introduction to the world of like online marketing and business was through Amazon FBA some guy selling good business opportunity course so I mean a lot of people can talk about like oh they're selling a course like it's a scam it's like oh not really because I I couldn't go like if I went back to that Amazon FBA guy and was like yeah you like did make me some money one because I actually did the thing but two it was more so the introduction into the arena that introduced me to more and more and

00:06:45	more and more and more ideas and what I can say in regards to that was I had that experience with Amazon FBA it required a lot of capital it was hot it was it was high highly Capital intensive it required a lot of money to purchase inventory so if you wanted to make more money you needed a lot of capital so I said to myself I want something that's more Capital efficient remember I had a I had a finance degree I literally was like thinking of this myself I just need something that's more Capital

00:07:11	efficient I need to produce income without needing a large amount of capital and this is when I started getting Tai Lopez ads for for social media marketing agency so I bought that course it was really good it was a phenomenal course a lot of people talk [ __ ] about him and it's like all the people that talk [ __ ] about the Tai Lopez social media marketing course like one didn't buy it two bought it and didn't do anything I bought it and just did the thing immediately like the the time between me consuming the

00:07:41	information and the implementation of the information was near zero I watched 100 through the content and followed it precisely it's very direct this is where people [ __ ] up with a lot of stuff but they they buy something or whatever whatever they just don't do the thing right so I buy that I I started off with like Facebook ads and service to like local businesses um I ended up I worked with like a med spa I worked with a club I worked with a guy at a club and he was my client for like do my use my client for like three years

00:08:14	like a really really long time all I was doing was just every single weekend he had some drink promo and then I would I would make ads for the drink promo and then like get people's phone numbers and emails and then like text number reminders to come get the drink promo it was super simple um but in hindsight what you realize is he was he was what I would consider like uh like a dream client and they pop up about one out of every 10 to 15 and what I mean by that it was it was basically impossible for me to quantify the return

00:08:45	to him but he was okay with that just him specifically because he was the kind of dude he was just like whatever he owned a [ __ ] ton of businesses and dude was just wealthy and he liked me too because he saw I was a young kid and he he probably looked at me as if I was him and he just kind of wanted to like support me and that's probably a reason why he stayed with me and now that does not happen a lot yeah so like because it couldn't directly quantify a return I'd get other clients and they just turn

00:09:16	because it was it was impossible for me like I just didn't conceptually understand this at first or if somebody's paying you money like a B2B service so for anyone who doesn't know what that means like B to b means I'm selling you a service where I'm gonna advertise for your business you need to get a return in order to to rationalize the reason why you're paying me to execute the service so I wasn't able to do that for other people and he was essentially like financing just because he like didn't

00:09:45	give a [ __ ] like that was it um and then I started just just I'm still like in the arena I'm I'm reading Russell Brunson stuff I'm I'm buying other people's courses I bought so many courses dude but the difference between me and other people is they buy courses and they say never go to the course I would buy a course and just immediately go through it like instantaneously yeah so like not go to bed until you like watch through all of it yeah like there's no like why did I buy this if I'm not gonna like it do it right so I

00:10:12	bought one it was it was about using automation follow unfollow to grow Instagram accounts this is back when this worked there was a period of time well it obviously it doesn't work now but there's a period of time where if you executed follow unfollow on Instagram you got a [ __ ] ton of followers and it worked yeah it worked like really really well so I started selling that as a service um I saw some other guys doing it like because I'm I was reading Russell Brunson stuff oh funnel hacking just

00:10:41	copy what's already working so I'm like all right I'll copy what's right and that doesn't mean copy people precisely it means like copy like the idea behind it I'm not selling to like rip off people's landing pages or like their precise offer like don't do that yeah um but the concept was that they were helping people get Instagram followers so I thought I'd be smart and I'd say I'd say Let me let me let me change the outcome for people I'm not going to get you followers on Instagram I'm gonna get

00:11:11	you more money on Instagram I'm gonna help you make more sales on Instagram so I go through this whole long sequence of people if there's a business count on Instagram a very large percent of them will have this button on their profile that says email and if you click the email button it gives you their email right so I was like I didn't have like a business page per se it was like my personal page so I was like I don't want to reach out directly through Instagram like that because there's no symmetry however I have a

00:11:45	landing page and if I email them and like send them the link to the landing page then they can get the contacts as to like actually yes this is business so that's what I was doing I figured I'd do email instead so I would go through profiles I picked I picked a random Niche just random Niche I picked Fitness coaches because there were so many of them it was really easy to find them picked it started going through the profiles manually clicking the email button copying it pasting it in a Google sheet and then

00:12:15	just doing this for like two hours a day like every single day every single day I did this for weeks weeks over and over and over and over again and then I would just make tests of like what's the best thing to say and I was doing this for months and this is originally how I got good at code email because there was just so much exposure and a lot of times what happens with people if they're sending cold emails is they'll spin it up in an automation tool this is one like how automation tools didn't even exist yet there was like a

00:12:46	couple and that was it I wasn't even aware of them um but a lot of people when they do cold email they'll spin up and spin it up on an automation tool but what that what that does if you do that it kind of removes the sentience from it like you don't feel it when you send the email yeah I went through months of my life where I was like handwriting like uh I would copy it put it in the Gmail Tab and like click Send where now what was happening when you were doing this is my conception of it was I'm speaking to one

00:13:24	individual human for every single time I do this now what people do is they get these automation tools they put a thousand emails in there they're thinking that they're speaking to a thousand people at once I and that's how they frame their conversation that's how they frame the conversation so what so my context hasn't evolved with cold email over time always from always was from the fundamental standpoint or I am emailing one individual human and if I'm gonna automate this I have to write the

00:13:55	email to one individual human and kind of backtrack it to be able to automatically send to a thousand people what other people do is they just automatically go I'm speaking to a thousand people this is why I got so good at it really fast so what happened with this is I was promoting that the the Instagram offer saying I'll make you more money and it kind of just like wasn't hitting and I was like dude what is wrong with this like I know these guys over here they're running this business they have like a

00:14:25	ton of clients they're getting like hella clients so why is this not working and I'm like well let me change like what I'm selling and this is I'm starting to go into like the offer like what's the value proposition like I'm saying make more money but when you really actually pay attention and I'm looking at the people I'm sending to I'm like half of these people don't even sell products so I just said I just started framing it as hey I can get you more followers as the value proposition instead bro

00:14:53	immediately it started cooking immediately I feel like that's like a lot of like Fitness coaches as well like um with that Niche specifically right it's not like the make money online type of Niche so when you know you're a fitness coach and it's like oh more followers or more money like you know Fitness coaches I feel like it's more of like a status thing so yeah I mean if they had a product it would have made more sense to tell them like hey I'll help you sell more of your product but just like 90 of them didn't have a

00:15:23	product so now this goes into like me understanding relevance of different people want different things so if I segmented it whereas like these people don't have a product these people do have a product and offered a different value proposition to each of these people it would have been more efficient for all of them you see what I mean so I started offering the more followers and at this point I'm 20 years old and I'm 25 right now but at this point running this business I'm 20 years old and I get it

00:15:54	to the peak it was about like 12 000 a month and my costs were bro I was spending like maybe four hundred dollars a month and I'm sitting here and I'm like dude this is an insane amount of money I this is enough to not have to work a job and it's it just keeps growing it just keeps going and going and going and going I'm like dude I think I can like legitimately take this to like a hundred thousand dollars a month like I'm pretty confident I can do this because my clients were staying they kept renewing over so I was

00:16:25	stacking mrr because I was getting the result and this is like my first exposure to that kind of thing because remember earlier I was talking about like the Facebook ads thing and everyone was churning because like I couldn't quantify results but this was the first time where it was so clearly direct that working with me is giving you results you see it immediately and you continue renewing because you want it to keep happening so I had all these clients getting them over and over bro I think I'm I think it was maybe like 5 percent

00:16:55	churned a month like that bro these states they stayed so long yeah and this is when I fully start experience experiencing this because I I'd be like I'd start the month and be like okay well I know for an absolute Baseline if I didn't even get more people this month I'm gonna make twelve thousand like I just know that's gonna happen and every acquired new customer is just going on top of that so I'm like wow dude this is a crazy efficient like what was what was the output that you had to do in order

00:17:24	to like fulfill it was literally like an automation tool and like once a week I had to go in for each client and just put in a new Target it took like 10 minutes for each for each solid yeah it was so fast it was it was legitimately probably like four or five hours work a week it was the rest of the time was just acquiring people yeah so obviously when you experience that you're like wow I can I can really scale this to 100K because it wasn't like you were like um you know when you're talking about

00:17:48	follow unfollow like you were going into all those pages and following following like all this is automatic yeah yeah and what this what this also did is it exposed me to what really I like about business I like the acquiring of customers I like the marketing side I really really enjoy that a lot I don't really like the operational side so we can kind of get into this later in the conversation about like the Symmetry between Andre and I and client Ascension um but I'm I'm the acquisition I like

00:18:18	getting them and then also like I understand like user experience or like customer experience and keeping people longer because that is marketing and that goes into like more of like an economic analysis of a business but that's that's actually more important as you get larger and larger and larger as opposed to acquiring new customers getting new customers gets boring at a certain point it's it's you'd rather just keep the ones you have because it's it's a puzzle and when you saw not a lot of people on the planet are able to

00:18:50	solve that puzzle if you were able to solve that puzzle of keeping your clients for a very long time it is impossible to not get rich it's impossible to not become wealthy it's a superpower and this is this is what like what a lot a lot of people don't understand and I I kind of hit on this in my content a lot where I'm telling people I'm like if you take all these last since I learned over time because I was able to compare it I had a business where people churned and then I had a business another business where people

00:19:24	stayed and then I had many other businesses after that and all of it was structured to be in such a fashion to where they would stay you see what I mean and that's what I have now with client Ascension like these they they stay because I took all the lessons from everything else I did and ejected it into that and it's it's so crazy to me when I see people they can be people can flux like oh just hit a 400k month or just hit a 500K a month or something like that and it's like yeah but you sold like a like a one-time

00:19:56	thing with no like kind of can like continue continuation where people like want to stay with you and you're not really like stacking up recurring revenue and the Art of Doing that bro it's it's impossible to lose money when you know how to do that it's I was I was a part of a company where um it was like that's like oh wow we just had our biggest month and then like the next month was you know maybe half that because it wasn't stacking it was like a single product it was a sale it was Black Friday so like that really

00:20:29	pushed that um but you know I think something with client Ascension like you guys have is it's like you're pushing people into client Ascension and you're just building this extremely sturdy solid foundation of results like I pretty sure every single time I log into Twitter I see results from client Ascension and you know obviously that's intentional that's on purpose and um it's real because like people are getting results and you are pushing those out and that just creates a stronger and stronger Foundation to just

00:21:00	continue to build on and that's like your stacking um you know progress with client attention which has been really cool to watch yeah dude I mean if like we signed not nine customers we signed nine customers just yesterday crazy simultaneously we are doing like at this moment because we've been like heavily like it's been a period of really working in customer experience and making sure people get results simultaneously as we have signed nine clients in a single day and we will probably have an all-time high month

00:21:32	this month we've spent less on ads and done less output of marketing this month but this month will probably be the all-time high month specifically because there's so many people renewing and staying it's stacking because they just stay so this is what people kind of don't understand I'll see people and they'll go yo look at this it's at 400k a month and I'm like yeah but like can you sustain a 400k month forever like for a really really really long time like are you functionally capable of operating

00:22:09	something like that because every new customer you get is a chance to produce a case study this is what your every single like a service business like a marketing agency or any kind of like Consulting type thing any kind of service business if it's like B to B like kind of like make more money or get more followers or what or subscribers or whatever anything like that every your the entirety of your business is just one functional system of a choir customer get case study use the case study to acquire more customers turn

00:22:42	them into a case study use that to get more customers it is this continuously oscillating cycle over and over and over again so get a customer get them results use those quantifiable results to acquire more customers it's just this flywheel continuously over and over and over and over again and if you can't predictably and repeatedly take someone and put them into this system you have developed and have them exit it with a very clear working of of a quantifiable result if you can't do that I promise you will

00:23:24	never grow a successful company and it's it's really crazy to me that like even just this past week I was like I've read Alex hermosi's book 100 million dollar offers I've watched all of his YouTube videos probably every single one and he's been doing it for a year and a half two years now he's been posting YouTube videos I think for two years and remember watching his YouTube videos like a year and a half ago and thinking like yo this is like really smart like this is really really smart and just

00:23:49	this last week I was going back and looking at some of the really old ones and it's almost as if like I just completely forgot what he said and I'm watching it again now and it hyper applies to me and I'm like yeah like I literally heard this before and it probably subconsciously implanted in my head and like I started just operating in that fashion but when they go back and it like re-inject it consciously it's like oh yes here's the precise action item I need to do and you're also at a different point when you're watching it

00:24:24	initially so now you go back it's like okay well X Y and Z has happened it's been you know five six months whatever and you know things have changed months have gotten bigger there have been more clients the team is bigger so it's like now there's more that you have to kind of fulfill in in that department and so when you see something like that you know you revisit it in a bunch of new things jump out at you and you're like oh like I should be doing that you know I can learn from that and Implement that

00:24:49	right away yeah I think um I think something else I've been thinking about lately and I was talking about this on client Ascension Consulting calls on this this happens with a lot of people um say you're running like a marketing agency or any kind of like service business what happens is I'm assuming you're below like 30 000 a month like if you're running a marketing agency or B2B Service Company in you're between like five thousand to thirty thousand dollars per month what kind of happens here is

00:25:15	you will hear a lot of conflicting information for instance what you will hear is you need one offer and you need to scale that one offer on one channel to like a million a month and while yes this is true but you can only do that if there is like if it's if it if the offer is exactly what people want in the form that they want it so what I'll see people do a lot is they'll they'll get stuck around like 20 or something like that and the reason why is because they have some fixed offer where they're like we do this this is

00:25:56	how much me we charge and this is the way we fulfill it like this is this is how we do it like you have and they talk to prospects and they try to push all those prospects into this one like box but the problem with it is that the box that they created was not created based off of the feedback of what people actually want so like I can give you a for instance of this with people who run um advertising agencies this happens all the time and I tell people if you're gonna sell to cold traffic it has to be

00:26:32	like what they want to buy like it has to speak directly to them precisely what they're thinking of right now and what a lot of advertising agencies will do I'll take uh like you're you're you're making ads and running ads for for e-com Brands what everyone wants to do is oh the client gives me all of the creatives and then I just media buy and you pay me a [ __ ] ton of money to do that but the problem with that is twofold and that they don't know how to make creatives like they want you to make the

00:27:07	creatives like they don't want to hire an advertising agency that doesn't make advertisements it doesn't make any sense yeah it was a unique I'm not paying media buyer they're paying an advertising yeah you need a creative to run ads and now they're saying well all what people say then is oh I'll just work with clients who like already have good creatives it's like well then how how did the client get the good creative it's probably because they're working with an advertising agency who makes them creatives and now you're trying to

00:27:35	scalp a client from another advertising agency that does make the creatives with your offer that doesn't make the creatives it just doesn't make any sense it makes zero sense at all and now what happens is say you do buy happenstance are able to get some client who has some amount of assets or something like that and you're able to use them in ads what happens is typically your client is not going to be a professional Advertiser so they don't have the understanding of what kind of creative needs to be produced so you arise into a

00:28:18	situation where your client can't get results because they're creative sucks and it's like the success of advertising is 80 everything to do with the creative like making actual good ads right and this applies to other offers and this is just an example that I'm using as an advertising agency what I tell people is if you're gonna try to sell ads as a service using outbound like code email you need to have a full encapsulating offer and say you do three thousand a month plus like 10 percent of gross profit and

00:28:57	that that's what your offer is what will happen is some people will be like well we don't I I don't know if we want to like have someone like run the ads for us can you just give us the creatives and then you can just say yeah like I can make you this much greater for this much congratulations you made a sale based off of what that one particular person wanted and this is why I see every single person I see who is one good at making creatives and then two creates a business selling ad creatives

00:29:29	it works really really well and this is exactly what happened with one of my clients Scott he was selling like explainer videos to software companies and like just wasn't really hitting right I was like Scott you're doing you're doing this wrong you're trying to sell like explainer videos but it's just like dumb like no one really wants like an explainer video however a software company that wants to advertise needs advertisements they need creatives and if you're pitching people that you'll make them ad creatives

00:30:02	you're hitting the kind of people who have money because they're going the the context is that they're going to spend money on ads if they're buying ad creative so they just have money you see what I mean yeah and it's it's kind of stuff like this that you that you have to look deep into and like extract some Nuance from it so it's like that makes logical sense why you would sell to sell people ad creators because the kind of person that buys accurate is the kind of person who spends money on ads if they

00:30:30	spend money on ads they have money like it's very simple yeah I think another thing too and you know I've kind of I've learned this is just when on the phone like on a sales call and uh you know creating a product that's relatively new uh sometimes you know the the person on the call be like oh like well do you offer this and then you think about it for a second you're like okay like we don't offer that but I know that this would be a key piece in closing this person and it's you know that's actually

00:30:56	a great thing that we could add to our you know our system right now and so you think about it for a second you're like yeah you know like we do offer that and you know you implement it right after that call and so I think you know like you said people just get stuck in creating that box where it's like oh like no we don't offer that this is you know this is what we do and it's like ultimately the customer has a problem and it's your job to solve the problem so it's like every problem is going to be slightly

00:31:20	different right but when you say for example with an advertising agency when the problem is not enough traffic like okay yeah the the the common problem is you know not enough traffic but you know each client is going to have its individual needs oh like you know we would love to do this but we need you to come fly out and shoot ads with us okay you know we can make that work or oh like you know we would love to do this but we need some like special effects on the ads like do you do that and it's like well if it's not initially

00:31:47	in your package like yeah just figure out like just add it like obviously if it makes sense so it's just like you might have to tailor things specifically for specific people and just like being open to that because every person is a unique person with unique problems yeah so this is this this is kind of what I was trying to get at it's like if you're below like 30k a month what you need to do is like you'll be on these calls with people and just in sales conversations whether that's on the phone or whether that's in the DMS

00:32:13	or whether that's in like comment somewhere like people are gonna ask you you will find that the the target market starts to ask you four things in a specific form so if you find a lot of people are not wanting a media buyer and they just want ad creatives kind of makes logical sense to sell them ad creatives because you can't just make this random box that fits you nicely or to I want to sell this it doesn't work like that you can only sell people what they want in the form that they want it but then with you

00:32:50	like with client Ascension right it's something that's more established and it's like you've built something based on all the people in your program so it's like you have this like Persona of person that you're targeting and looking for and so it's like this person comes to your program they're like XYZ like I want that I want that one okay yeah I'm interested and and then they're joining because because they want to be in that box right you're like this is the Box do you want to be in the box or not whereas

00:33:15	like when you're below that 30k a month it's like you know you don't have that box you know you can't just make a box at a finish that's what I'm saying people make a box out of thin air it's just like my boss you have to you make your box over time and it is only when you have created the box like after speaking to people like you need you need to implement what people are asking for so it's a client Ascension over a very long period of time it's gone through many different forms we start adding done for you components we add

00:33:44	like one-on-one calls a lot of stuff here we got this we have we have this segment over here this over here this this this it it evolves over time because you need to give people specifically what they're asking for and this applies to any single kind of business and something I can note is say for instance I'll use this as another example like the the same example as before the advertising AG where you might be like well like if if I have the box where I just like pay pay get paid to run the ads and do the media buying

00:34:16	and I don't have to do the creatives it's gonna cost me like a lot of money to make the creatives and like a lot of time to do that to which my response to you would be well what if I gave you ten thousand dollars yeah and then you'd be like oh well yeah then it can work they're like okay well then tell that to the prospect you happen to get on the phone with someone who's like yeah we want to spend like a hundred thousand dollars per month on ads right they're like like a very large business now what would happen is you'd

00:34:41	backtrack this and be like okay well if you want to spend like 100 Grand in eyes you're probably gonna need like you're gonna need somewhere like 40 50 new creatives every single month so we're gonna need to have to we're gonna have to do this we're gonna have to buy your product we're gonna have to get like models and and shoot here we're gonna have to like find creators and make ugc ads and this many ugc ads and here's the plan and it'll it'll segment out like this like this like this like this like this and here's the whole

00:35:05	point of how that creative system would work like that and now what you're doing is if you're on a call with someone and you're explaining this to them well if you want to spend this much money on ads this is required this much volume is required and here is how this volume needs to be executed this is the precise roadmap with which it needs to happen and then you explain how actually extensive this really is and now Prospect is looking at this and they're saying oh yeah that's like a lot of work can you do that for me and

00:35:36	you're like oh yeah so like all this would be would be eight thousand dollars for every month to produce for to produce this much amount and now they're sitting here and if they're an actually sizable company they'll be like oh yeah so like I would either have to like go do all this myself or hire a full-time person to go do this but then like I need to train the person to know how to do all of this correctly but you have this experience and you know how this works already so like yeah this actually just makes sense

00:36:01	to give you eight thousand dollars per month plus like a performance based off for for you to actually profit off it exactly what I mean and and like with that too it's you know again like you're you're tailoring based on the person I know for us like we have a short form content agency right not everyone wants the exact same package like we don't have a box and we're probably not going to get to a point where we have a box either right okay yeah we have a package look this is like you know if you're

00:36:27	interested that's what we have but you know for some people it's like oh we need to shoot in person oh like we have podcasts we need to send you those podcasts oh we have YouTube videos we need that oh like we have to shoot stuff over like basically like zoom and it's like it's different for every single person and then it's like oh we want one clip a day oh we want two we want three okay that's different oh we we only want to post on this platform oh we want to post on all three so it's like okay you

00:36:47	know there's there's no box for us you know it's every single client is different we're just accommodating so it's like we can accommodate those needs so this is what I tell people a lot I go if you're if you're running kind of like a business like yours like around that size your sales process will be dirty what I mean by Dirty is an example is taking someone who say you're pitching somebody I don't know SEO and you go and you analyze their site and you like all right well for you to get for you to get

00:37:18	more customers you'd want to rank on this keyword this one this one this one this one um these keywords are super competitive though so you'd have to like get this many backlinks and this much content it would probably take this amount of time and then this one over here will be this much this much this much this much and then you're explaining this to them and what you do is you assess the difficulty of what is required for them to win and then backtrack that what do you want to be compensated to

00:37:52	execute that difficulty correct this is what people don't understand because they have the one box where it's like oh no I just like I'm an Su agency I'm going to write you five pieces of content I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm Gonna Get You 10 backlinks a month that's it I'm gonna fit you in this box and it's like no like what is required for you to win specifically explain it to them explain all of the Nuance that would need to happen and then present them a price that makes economic viable sense for you

00:38:23	is that like what's worth your time I think a lot of people too is like when they get started they're you know and you have to do this when you get started they're afraid to like lose a deal so like they're afraid to like you know put a price on like their full worth you know but for us you know obviously like you guys it's it's completely different too you know we've gotten to the point where it's like okay you know we've done this enough times where it's like we know like how much work this actually

00:38:45	takes based on what they're saying so you know someone gets on the call it's like yeah like that's gonna be you know six grand a month and it's like oh well like that's too much it's like sorry like you know it's it's a lot of work you know it's not not easy to you know film edit and post three videos a day on three different platforms like you know it's nine videos going out every single day you know what that's like 270 videos a month so it's like sorry like we can't just do that for you know Pennies on the

00:39:12	dollar and like you get an understanding of that work once you start doing it so then when people get on the phone it's like man like it has to be this number or I just like it just doesn't make sense I feel like what screws lot of people up is they'll they'll see they're they're getting on sales calls and maybe they're like they're like oh I'm not like really good at sales I'm like super nervous to get on this call um and it screws a lot of people up and what you should do instead if you were to phase out like the sections of a

00:39:38	sales call like one of them is Discovery and what you're doing in Discovery don't think of it as like a mechanized thing in the beginning just kind of like ask gun like what do you want what would be your ideal outcome for working with me like what do you want to happen it's like oh you're selling you're selling uh e-commerce email marketing you use clavio to write them emails or whatever say they currently make like 10K a month like 15 of their sales come from from email they're like oh we'd really like to get up to around like 25

00:40:08	30 um maybe do like 20 grand a month on on email and then now you now you know what they want and then you go and you look and see what they have it's like okay well like can like let me audit it real quick let me see what you have and then you go like how many flows do they have how many automations over here how many emails are they sending a week and you tell them what oh so what would be required for you to get to that number is this we'd have to do this you have to do this we have to do this we have to do

00:40:37	this this this this this and you want to send about three emails a week over here um and but coming up with those ideas for the emails you don't want to just constantly push like discounts or whatnot because that's going to Discount your brand so you need to come up with like creative angles to promote things and then um present upsells for People based on something else that that they bought and then and you start giving them like an action plan and like if you did all this it it would be reasonable that you should hit this

00:41:04	number yeah okay well how much does it cost let's say you're fixed let's go it would be be three thousand dollars a month and maybe they say something like oh I mean like I mean like we have product costs and like it it costs a lot of money or like yada yada or whatever but you just gave them this action plan and if you're confident that you could like if you do all of this like you a hundred percent should be able to get to this then you could like counter offer because it might be worried about like

00:41:31	you can't actually get the results so they want a form of risk reversal so you could either one give them a guarantee well if I can't get it to this number in this x amount of days I can just like refund you um or you could do it based off of how about we do a performance fee based off the increase from your Baseline so you're doing about 10K a month right now I think I can get you about 20 25k a month so what if we did fifteen percent of the increase or something like that you see what I mean yeah and then you just and it's you have

00:42:02	them for a really long time you're sending emails and you know you write an email and then over time their stuff grows a lot and you could scale it down as like they if they grow like super massive or it's like go you send an email that maybe 50 Grand they're probably gonna be not not too happy giving you like 4 000 for a single email that's what that's what I did with um you know the actually when I first like kind of got into things right so when I when I started out I was at a dealership I was like the videographer

00:42:30	the dealership I didn't really know what I was doing they didn't really know what they wanted you know all their stuff was just like iPhone stuff so it's like anything that I made was better than what they had um so that was like a starting off point for me and then I went and worked with like a startup you know like a personal brand type thing and um I didn't really know what I was offering but I knew or like not that I didn't know I was offering I knew I was going to be like a videographer and like

00:42:56	make content but I didn't know like to what degree that really looked like so I was like okay well I know that um you know this is going to help Drive Revenue so what I want to do is I want to structure myself and be like you know at the time I was like 18 so I was like I'll charge 2K a month right and that was like a significant amount of money for me as a you know 17 18 year old kid um because I had like some other clients at like that level as well and then I said I was like okay whatever your highest month is in Revenue

00:43:25	anything that we scale past that um I'll take 25 off and so the dude was like oh yeah that's cool and so that you know 2K retainer turned into thirteen thousand dollars one month later because you know we just blew past that and so you do something like that performance fee you know people they kind of lower their guard a little bit because they're like oh like that's not that much um obviously you want to make sure you have a contract in place um and you want to make sure that it's sustainable

00:43:55	but with that you know usually they're more than happy to get it because the you know they're getting the result right you're getting paid because they are making more money which is ideal yeah yeah so something something else to note is there's there's sometimes a psychological aspect to this and the best way I can explain it is how I buy services and what I recommend my clients to so I'm going to use an example Eddie and Brady who are they do Tick Tock ads on Tick Tock organic stuff and they're

00:44:21	helping me with Tick Tock ads so like their offers they'll it's like a it's a fixed amount plus a a percent of gross revenue so it's uh Revenue minus ad spend but I told them I don't want you to manage my ads I want you to script my ads and I want you to edit my ads because I want to know what's happening in the ads manager I want to be the person who knows how to do it I want to like post the ad I want to like individually me I want to see the direct result of it so how about I could just pay you like a Consulting

00:45:05	amount or like a fixed amount for like the ad creation and they're like yeah yeah we can do that so now I turned into a Consulting deal for them which you can do it's just sometimes it's not so like say for instance that they said that they said um no sorry you don't fit into our our box here but all right well that's stupid like yeah why not like I'm lost like a great potential case study yeah you know I'm trying to pay you money like and like I'm relatively big and like have a big force behind me on

00:45:36	Twitter so if I have if you have a case study with me where it's like then and they understood this they're like okay yeah yeah you're like a pretty sizable person here if I can get you like they didn't try to force me into this box I didn't want to be in they just said okay yeah yeah we can do that it was advantageous set up for them this is what people do they screw this up or they'll talk to a prospect and they're just like oh no sorry we only do this and it's like bro what are you doing yeah like we we literally had one dude

00:46:00	he like I'm in Miami and he's like in Brickell so he's like 15 minutes away um by car and um like he literally got on on the phone with us and he was like yeah so like I just want to record a bunch of videos I'm completely cool if we only post one like I just want to record a bunch of videos to see like the quality of all those videos and like I literally just like want you guys like in the room so you can like kind of Coach me through it and like you know for the energy I was like sounds good to me like that's dope

00:46:29	like you know I'm I'm super happy to set up all my gear and like help make some some cool videos for you um and and do that so it's like it just I think for us like it's kind of gotten down to it's like okay like we have clients and it's like we have a potential clients like do we want to work with that person or do we not want to work with that person and it's like if we don't want to work with that person um but they're willing to pay well and it's like okay like do we want to make this exception do we not

00:46:56	um if they're going to be a pain like probably just not want to work with them or if it's someone like you know recently I just signed a client that I've been uh wanting to work with for like a couple years so you know with that I was literally like I went and I shot a podcast with him um and I was like it was really tough to do that because he's like a really big and in his space and so and I'm like not super huge in like the similar space so but I knew him from the past like company that I was with and

00:47:25	um I finally got like a uh to do a podcast with him I was like yo like I'll literally shoot a podcast for you I'll edit all the clips and I'll send you the clips so that you have and so you know he made the time I shot the podcast with him and then every single day I sent him a clip until he signed with us and um it took two weeks of sending him a clip every single day before he signed with us and it there's two lessons in that one the clips were good Clips they were performing really well on a social

00:47:56	right he has an existing following but you know some of the clips got like over 100k views which relative to his other stuff was you know an increase so that was good um and then just like the consistency of just sending him a clip every day hey here's another clip hey here's another clip and then you know they kind of get used to it they're like oh this is nice you know like I get a clip and I get to post the clip and then the clip gets views and um you know obviously that just like lowers all like the the what's the one

00:48:27	I'm looking for like the the barrier of entry and um they're just like oh you know this this is what I want so obviously you don't want to do that for everyone like we have to be very picky about who we do that with because some people will take advantage like you have to know the person um like I know like his morals and like where he stands with things so you know that played into the decision of you know deciding to do that but I think a lot of people are just unwilling to to kind of take that route of you know for

00:48:51	me it's like I really want to work with this clients so like if I have to work with him for free for three months before I get there like you know I'm down so yeah so this this is the people people underestimate the amount of work and the frequency with which like high high value clients show up typically you get most of your like high value clients through extraneous effort like that or like you're connected to them in some form of network if it's outbound and this was both yeah it was both but if you're if you're doing like

00:49:26	outbound and you're going for high value prospects I mean they make millions of dollars a year and you're gonna try to sell them like a ten thousand dollar per month plus thing it takes a lot of effort to do that and now something to I see this all the time I love clients and they um it goes back to that box thing where they try to fit them into just random box and what will happen is people will if you don't get a ton of call volume it's super easy to get discouraged because I could give you math on my end and stats for my end

00:49:58	40 of people that submit an application to client Ascension just make zero dollars it's like no I'm not working with you so 40 of the people come through just are 100 not qualified and then there's about four and a half percent of applications that make a hundred thousand dollars per month plus you're saying this is after they've gone through the program or when they come to the program no when they submit their initial application as like an inquiry into like schedule a sales call with us and a lot of people who who are in the

00:50:35	hundred thousand dollar per month plus not a lot of the client attention isn't really made for them it's made for people who are somewhere in the range of like three to four thousand to like fifty thousand a month like around there that's who it's made for it was specifically designed for that section of the market but there's these two other ends that aren't hit but what people would do is say they're selling uh like uh I don't know I think it's three thousand four thousand dollars per month what their ideal section when

00:51:10	you're selling a done for you service your ideal section is that they're making somewhere like to thirty thousand to one hundred thousand but what this does with a lot of people is it's leaving out that other section of like five to twenty nine yeah and they'll get on calls with these prospects and they'll just be no you don't fit my box by and it's like no sell them some kind of like just form of deliverable where it's like say your Ecommerce email marketing say all right say you're not gonna go like

00:51:43	continuously run all their email campaigns on a on a you could sell them a flow build out you could design like a one-time thing and just get some kind of revenue from them like yeah and build that connection extract from the market like that section sell them what they would buy no one hops on the phone with you if they don't want to purchase something to make more money in the form that makes sense for them for sure and you know with that it's like yeah you have those people on the low end you have those people on the

00:52:18	high end and you know it's not just yes like there's Revenue there absolutely but it's also like if you sell them something now like you're building that connection with them so you know it say it's a little guy right say he's doing 2K a month you know okay you know it's something that's you know okay you you give them something that helps his business grow now his business grows 10x now he's at 20K a month well now he's a fit for client Ascension and now you know he had a good experience with you

00:52:45	in the past so him coming back and being like Oh I want your product it's like that sales call is just going to be a breeze because you already have that touch Point like a big touch Point yep that's how it works that that is that is that is exactly how it works uh people people people make decisions when you are kind of this happens a lot with like younger people um maybe you haven't been in business I've been like full-time entrepreneur for I think like five years now but if you're like just starting to get into

00:53:12	this maybe you're less than a year in or like less than two years in the kinds of decisions you make what you're what they're doing is they're not planning for what would happen in two years three years five years from now everything they're doing is with the context of like how can I make more money right now or like in like two or three months so you're looking at something like oh I'm not gonna like spin up an offer where I just like sell them the the flows or whatever like that they're not operating under the context that that

00:53:47	that person could become a really good client a year from now and the reason they don't do that is because they haven't even existed for a year they don't think in those time Horizons people think oh I don't even know if I'll be in this business a year from now and if you continuously think to yourself and make decisions based off the context of I don't know if I'll be in this business a year from now you just won't be in business a year from now you everything you do needs to be under the context and intention that

00:54:21	you're going to be doing this for at minimum three years like minimum three years playing the long game yeah and even then when you first start it's like dude it might be like six months do you get your first client like so some people can go faster if they're like if they're just like gung-ho like yeah I'm just gonna offer people I see this so much bro people will get people get on sales calls and they'll get on like 10 sales calls in a row and they just like ask the prospect the the the revenue it

00:54:52	was like and they put this number in there well I only work with people at this at this level and Prospect will say the revenue but oh sorry I don't think we'll be a fit it's like well what they actually could have like you you operated no Discovery process you didn't find out what are their problems right now you know how much money they have saved in their bank account you don't know like how much risk they're willing to take to get this to go they're just an automatic DQ people and just tell

00:55:15	them to [ __ ] off and it's like bro are you that that's not what you do more specifically for a very important reason and that you need to like talk to them to get market research because you start doing this continuously over and over and over and you're talking to all different kinds of people in one industry across all different Revenue levels and all different kinds of situations and you start to understand what is my target market more specifically what are their emotions and exact syntax they use to convey

00:55:48	information to me and you find out what they're thinking you find out what they want and that allows you to morph your box into something that is cohesive and hits a large section of people that exist in the market people just Auto DQ people oh sorry you're too big bye bro you're out of your mind like no you have someone in your Market on the phone right now like find out what they want like really dig deep and try to figure out like What's Happening Here you do this so you do this 10 20 30 40 50 times

00:56:23	it's like dude you can just recite what they want exactly and what that means is you can you can write a code email that recites what they want you can you figure out what their problems are and you figure out how to solve them and it's like now when you're speaking to them you're speaking to them in a way where it's like I'm a solution you know and you know that's something that you know I've noticed as well as like just like in being on sales calls and this isn't for like content business but

00:56:49	um you know for uh my trading stuff it's like you get on calls and it's like after you talk to enough people and after you get to know yourself enough it's like you start to realize what the common problems are and what people want to hear and I think there's a dark side to that right because it's like yes you want to be able to know what their problem is and understand like how to fix it and speak to them in terms of like this I'm going to be the solution but there also has to be fulfillment to

00:57:15	back that up because a lot of people you know they'll they'll have just the marketing piece where it's like they learn how to speak to these people and tell them exactly what they want to hear and then when it comes time to fulfill there's just nothing there or it's just subpar and I would love for you to talk a little bit about that because you know that's something that you said you are a marketer and you know that's what you enjoy and if you could just talk about like your partnership with Andre and how

00:57:39	you know the Fulfillment and the marketing kind of works with that yes Andre heichel and then Christian Bonnie or Dan Crowley they're my business partners in in client Ascension um you can kind of segment it out um almost every kind of business I guess in like my range and most of the people that people watching this video are selling to is it can kind of be delineated into three business segments where there's marketing and lead generation and there's sales like the actual operation of the sales conversations and

00:58:11	then fulfillment and operations behind it so I lead I guess you could say the marketing and Legion I am responsible for getting the people interested in client Ascension and getting them on the phone and and building Goodwill in the market I that's my job I do that Dan is in charge of the sales team and the sales team actually has the conversations with the prospects they relay information to me I relay information to them what happens in fulfillment I'm still in the operations I still I get on

00:58:46	one-on-ones with people on client attention I'm very active in there I run coaching calls inside condensation so I'm seeing what they're saying I can take that information from what they're saying inside my actual active clients use that in marketing relay it to the sales team and then Andre similarly can relay what problems people are having as well because he's also in fulfillment and then I can relay that back to marketing to generate more leads you see what I mean it's just like passing of information back and forth

00:59:18	but something to note is that the these segments of the business are each individual full-time 80-hour Work Week jobs like they really are and like the way I can delineate this to you is with Andre for instance it's not just operating coaching calls inside client Ascension and like responding to the clients it's like hiring customer success managers and then making sure they know how to relay information to people and then like making sure that they're doing a good job like taking care of people and then

00:59:57	making sure they're responsive to me and relaying information to me to which then I can go talk to the clients and make sure that they're getting results right and hiring people managing the systems and like the tech behind it that is a full call reviews and like just making checking up on everyone that's a full-time job yeah I think like like with that you know like each of those things is a full-time job and so you know but people don't when they see it they don't necessarily understand what that really looks like so you know yeah

01:00:28	we're doing a podcast here but like this is working you know like this is in marketing you're creating content for people to consume and build trust with people and then push them towards client Ascension so like this right now it's like you're technically on the clock I guess you could say correct the literal function yeah with this podcast right now is to establish to have you establish a parasocial relationship with me inquire in some fashion maybe go watch more videos maybe go to my Twitter maybe

01:00:58	you go opt into client Ascension and now you're on my email list and you're seeing the email list and I'm giving you good information maybe it's something you can put into practice you try it maybe a couple months of lapse and you're like wow this stuff that this guy talks about is actually like really good and now that I like this guy and I've I've been exposed to the fact that he actually does know what he's talking about I've seen the results he's got with other people screw it I'm going to join client

01:01:23	Ascension and then you get other kind of stuff where it's I literally have this sign back here that says client Ascension and you're just looking at that sign that says client Ascension it's just subconsciously implanting into you like the name like the naming behind it I couldn't quantify that look what's the return what's the differential return between us being on this podcast and that sign not being there versus the sign being there what's the what's the ROI I don't know like you have to do

01:01:48	stuff like that like I don't know like how doing this podcast right now like how many clients is that going to bring in I don't know look I have no idea and I will never be able to measure it all I know is that if you consistently do things like this over and over and over and over and over again it is not one individual piece of content that produces results it is the aggregate of a ton of content that was that people were exposed to in whatever sequence that they went through that delivers conversions that's how it works works

01:02:22	it's not one cold email that gets the results it's the one code email and the follow-ups and then what they responded and then the the personalized video you sent back and then they went to your landing page and you didn't even see that and they watched your video sales letter and they saw all your results over there and then you had a YouTube linked on it and they went and subscribed to you on YouTube and watched two videos and then they thought about it for three weeks and they sent a link to someone in their slack

01:02:48	and then a month later some issue arises in the business and someone says Hey like you remember that guy maybe he can help us with that like oh yeah I do remember that guy like yeah wait where is he like what was his name again oh yeah let me scroll up they find the YouTube link oh he's over here and then they and then they click the YouTube link and then like they click the the link to your website in in the YouTube and then they book a call through there and then what you're thinking is that like maybe you were doing UTM tracking

01:03:15	on the thing you said oh YouTube got me a client but actually it was the cold email you see I was just aggregation bunch of touch points oh [ __ ] everywhere scattered throughout the ether where it's like you have no idea what exactly it is that delivers the results all I know is that the more you do the more it works I think it really boils down to a big psychological game as well like for example that's just a huge touch Point like people are gonna be staring at that like the whole video like that just

01:03:46	becomes like you know ingrained in your brain right just comes at a touch point and you see it somewhere else you're thinking about I think what it really comes down to with with personal Brands because um you know there's I view businesses in like two types of ways majorly right you have businesses like Coca-Cola they're like faceless Apple faceless mostly faceless and then you have like personal Brands like client Ascension like client Ascension is known for having your face behind it for having Andre's face behind

01:04:11	it right so it's known for a personal brand and so the more people um that you are reaching throughout the day uh that's maybe not the best way to say it but the more times that you're able to get in front of a single person in a given time and it also matters how you get in front of that them right if you get in front of them as an authority as someone that knows who they're talking about as you know someone that's cool someone that you know has the vibe versus you know an idiot or um someone that's making a fool of

01:04:41	himself online there's obviously different ways to do that but it's like if you're doing that in multiple different ways you're doing that on Twitter you're doing that on YouTube YouTube show Sports take talk Andre's on Instagram right uh cold email uh so you have all these different touch points so it's like the more that you can get people to think about you throughout the day the better because you know they're they're taking up mental bandwidth and they're thinking about they're thinking about it so it's like oh like is client

01:05:06	Ascension gonna help me is it not like even just them thinking about it is a step in progression versus like am I gonna play golf today it's just yeah it's just occupying human bandwidth that's right that's what all you're doing dude I was listening to an interview with Grant Cardone and he goes and I I swear I've been thinking about this and he just put it so well so simple and right when I heard it I was like bro it's so [ __ ] true what he says is your creative ad won't beat my frequency and for anyone who doesn't know what

01:05:37	frequency means it's typically a measure of advertising where like you could take a seven days like how many times did the average person see this ad in some X time period that would be frequency so what what's my seven day frequency if it's 14 it means the average person saw your ad 14 times in a week but it doesn't just apply frequency frequency doesn't just apply to ads it applies to everything across all channels so someone might be following me on Twitter following me on LinkedIn subscribe to my YouTube and

01:06:11	then they might see me like [ __ ] 50 times a week for eight months and that's what it took for them them personally to trust me and then end up becoming a client because they arose into the exact position to where they believe that my product would be the gateway to them achieving their desired result and to and to piggyback off of that as well like I'm I'm the type of person that's like very skeptical about like buying something online so I really want to like be consumed in the person like to make sure that you know okay

01:06:52	like is this person like legit right so um you know but I've also caught myself just like buying stuff just because like I believe in the person and like I I love what they have to say it's like with Iman like I bought his like agency Navigator thing in the digital Renaissance thing because I literally watched the whole thing and like obviously like I'm a videographer and like I I just watch everything I was like this is insane I just had so much respect for it I literally like felt bad at me and I was like this was so good

01:07:21	like I just want to be like part of it to some degree so like you definitely have that piece of it and then there's also it's like you know okay well I could be going through my entire year right January February March April May maybe when I get to August right and I'm like consuming your content right so it's like I'm watching you know Daniel tweet about this you know talk about this on YouTube and I'm seeing all this and then it's like yeah that's super cool like I love consuming his content it's great and then like I get to August

01:07:46	it's like oh I have this problem I need to solve this problem and it's like well you've been the person that I've been consuming for the whole year and it's like oh well that that's my go-to for the problem and I think that's the the case of what it is like with advertising like if you're you know like the one-time ads type of thing you're getting the people that are impulsive you're you're hitting those people that have the problem now but when you are building a personal brand you are um just creating like you're creating

01:08:14	this timeline where it's like eventually when they have that problem then they come to you dude do you want to know something crazy so like I've been I've been I've been in Tick Tock ads and like we've closed people like like you've got some leads from Tick Tock ads in like one call close some of them and then like I have high rows I can see like everything you click like I I know the whole journey you go through because I I put tracking stuff I use print tracking I see everything you click whether it's

01:08:39	an email or whatever or whatever when you end up buying I can go and look like what's everything you did and I'll look at some of these people and look we've closed people from Tick Tock where it's just Tick Tock ad schedule call immediately one call closed and I'm like you're a [ __ ] psychopath like I would never do that yeah I promise I would never ever do that like I just wouldn't but some people it probably just spoke so perfectly to them and maybe they did go on like my YouTube and watch some stuff

01:09:09	like before the call or something like that but maybe they did some research and they're like okay yeah yeah our sales guys aren't [ __ ] they're not gonna sell they literally won't offer you if they don't think you're a good fit like based off your particular situation regardless of how much you make this this kind of what happens in them in the sales team chat whenever someone's like thinking about offering you they'll be like hey what is this like do you guys think this offer would work and they like tag everyone like me

01:09:33	Andre Christian Dan and some other people and then we'll just say yes this this will 100 work that that's definitely gonna work yeah yeah give them a guarantee like we'll guarantee them results I know this will work um and but everything I've done over time like in terms of like producing content on Twitter and Linkedin and YouTube I'm operating it under the context if I want to position myself in such a fashion to wear all of the stuff I've done I would have been able to have sold myself because I would have watched hella [ __ ]

01:10:12	continuously over and over and over and over again so like I I've been telling myself this way I was like I need a hundred hours of Me on YouTube I need a hundred hours of Me on YouTube because I would probably watch a hundred hours of someone on YouTube over a long period of time I think that's like what it takes too for because like I'm like the same way where it's like I want to go on to Instagram and see like okay this person has a history like I want to go back and see you know say for example

01:10:41	I'm gonna use a Trader for example um I want to go back and I want to see okay what was your last month like what was your last year like what was your last five years like you know okay maybe you know you're on the come up and it was in five years that's cool like you know I'm just not gonna pay you as much because you're not as experienced right so someone's been in the game for 10 years versus someone that's been in for a three you know it's like okay um one of my one of my buddies um that became my buddy because I went

01:11:07	through his product you know he was kind of on the come up and I just like I watched closely I was like okay let me see what he's posting let me see um you know his videos his YouTube videos and it was like okay like I you know I've consumed basically all of his content and I like what he has to say and I bought his 200 product it was a 200 product but I consumed also like the trading space you know there's there's a lot of scammers in space so it's like I wanted so many it's the worst one yeah

01:11:36	that's the worst industry with the most scammers yeah so obviously like I wanted to do my you know even though it was a 200 product I wanted to vet it all out right so I like I watched all the dudes content because I I want to see it's not like I'm not just buying for the sake of buying I'm buying because I want to solve my problem so it's like you know I need to consume all this content it's not about the 200 that I'm spending it's that if I spend this money will it solve my problem and so I'm vetting this guy out to see hey

01:12:06	what he's talking about do I believe do I think that what he's saying and you know what he knows and what he's going to teach in that course is enough to solve my problem and if the answer is yes then I'm hitting the buy button if it's no then it's like I'm moving on to someone else yes I think something something that I think people discount a lot is having an association or recommendations from high profile people or just just even being in the same vicinity or a single picture or a single video with

01:12:40	somebody who is high profile and also has a lot of respect in like in industry and kind of like an example that comes off the top of my head is someone like Brian mancata so Brian moncata is probably the best YouTube advertising guy on the planet like actually he's probably the best YouTube Advertiser on the planet and now I've appeared in videos with Brian moncata and Brian moncata did a presentation at one of my client Ascension events and I'm I've in pictures with Brian moncada so anyone in Brian moncada's Network who ever sees me

01:13:14	with Brian is going to associate his level of professionalism and expertise it's automatically relayed to me yeah because Brian moncada wouldn't associate with me if I also didn't have expertise he quite literally wouldn't right and if you're able to get into networks like this or like go join like masterminds or something like that and like actually talk to people and like exert yourself out into the world and like associate with high profile people you are gonna be all so much better off and I can give you an example of this I

01:13:54	was on a Consulting call someone someone wants to get a on on a call with me just like a one-off call he just wanted to talk to me about like scaling his thing um we were talking about Twitter and like Twitter marketing and whatnot and he's gotten like he's gotten in fights with people before and whatnot with some like bigger accounts and whatnot and like and what that did he discounted how actually detrimental that is that you don't want to be ostracized by the people who are the largest yeah you

01:14:29	don't want that to be a thing that's that's so incredibly bad for you because if you were to if you were to associate like probably 70 of what made me get so big on Twitter I have like 117 000 followers right now I've had it for about three years that wouldn't have happened if I didn't earn the respect of the people who were at one point larger than me it wouldn't have happened it actually wouldn't um I remember I don't know if you know Rogue wealth on um on on Twitter I've heard of him yeah yeah but he was like

01:15:07	huge like cell sales guy when I first started on Twitter and like he had a big account I think at the point at that point he had like I don't know 40K 50k followers or something like that he had a lot of respect like got just really good guys very knowledgeable and to earn the respect of him and get a vouch from him was a vouch to his entire network 40 000 followers yeah so now the context of me having his respect is implanted to 40 000 other people immediately like he's following me they go to my

01:15:39	profile and they say oh like I really like this Rogue wealth guy and he's following this guy so like they're they're Associated or something like that and now this kind of translates with me as well where it's like I tell people in client essential like if you're on Twitter and whatnot I'm like start producing sales assets on Twitter I'm gonna follow you and like interact with it because I have the respect of hella high profile people and I have 117 000 followers who are gonna see it when I interact with it we have a we have an

01:16:12	example as well like you know like I said with that big like client of mine that you know we just got I worked for like two weeks to go ahead and sign him right and then we had another dude um I still don't even know like how he was able to book a call with us like I don't know where he came from you know it wasn't from uh one of our conventional ways I think he was like referred by someone or something or you know was told to just go book a call with us and um so we got him on the call didn't know

01:16:40	him he didn't know us and he was like oh yeah like you know this is what I'm looking for he didn't actually really even know what he was looking for like we just like talked about it with him and got him to the point where um he was like okay I think this is like what I want um and you know based on what his problems were and he was also in the same space that I had just signed you know my larger client and you know the larger client has been in the space for 10 years and so pretty much everyone in

01:17:06	that space knows him and so I was like oh yeah he's like one of our clients bro signed the contract so fast like and didn't even like know us it was just like insane so like your network really is I mean it's so cringe to say your network is your net worth but it's like in reality you know like you said it just like when you are networked with that person it just unlocks you know so much it does dude I I've I've I've experienced this sometimes where like um um someone kind of high profile I guess

01:17:37	you could say joins client Ascension they have like a lot of followers or whatever and I'll tweet that I'll be like this person just joined client Ascension just immediately a bunch of college books and they're like because it's fomo yeah oh like I want to be in there too he's inclined Ascension too yeah yeah I want to be in there that that's how it works it's it's intangible there's so many intangibles you have to employ this is what I tell people like my clients I'm like dude you need to just be making content

01:18:08	and displaying your competence and what you're capable of and like showing people what you know how to do and making videos often like if you if you got if you have a case study with a client and you were able to make them like a bunch of results like turn that into a big document and like share it on Twitter and then show like make a video on it on YouTube how I was able to get the results and walk people through the whole process and this goes back to what we were talking about earlier with sales

01:18:34	conversations where I was saying like this person wants to get this you find out what they want explain what is required in order to get that result and this is exactly how you would present a case study because if this client came in they wanted to get these results so because they wanted to do this here's what needed to happen I did this this this this and because of this and this is this I got the results from that so I took that data and was able to produce this this this this this this this is

01:19:00	this all this stuff and what happens is over time I had to keep iterating this over and over and over again and testing this and I finally found this winner and then we we did this with the winner and then we tested all this and found another winner and yada yada whatever the [ __ ] you did and it turned out at the end of the engagement six months later with client now they're here bam cool so now this does two things right it it does one thing is that you provide proof that you are capable of doing this

01:19:27	and it similarly also shows that you understand a hyper degree of nuance and you know what is required because when people who run larger companies what they're trying to do when someone is like thinking about purchasing offer for you especially if they're a larger company they're less interested in a guarantee or a risk reversal than they are interested in their certainty that you will get the results large companies who buy from you don't want their money back they want to pay you and get the

01:19:59	result yeah that's the difference I was I was on a call once and um you know it was like I was going through everything I was like okay so like you know what's you know what what am I gonna what am I gonna get out of this and you know it's like oh like we're gonna give you X Y and Z I was like okay so cool like what happens if you don't get that for me it's like oh well then we refund your money I'm like I don't want my money refund I want the result and you know yeah like a I think a risk-free thing is

01:20:27	is good but you know the whole reason that they showed up on your calendar is because they want the result of you know whatever you're saying that you're going to get the result of so you know it's it's more so about the actual outcome than it is like the guarantee for it because you know they're not they're not giving you their money so that they can get it back they're giving you their money so they can get the desired outcome that they signed up for the entire function of having a guarantee when you're when

01:20:55	you're a beginner is to just get some demand generationally get people like something you need to get someone in the door so that you can produce the case study and deliver the result and it is only when you have the results and the proof that larger higher profile better businesses will work with you the entire function of the guarantee is to be able to Horizon into that situation now on the back end you could still have a guarantee and all the results and you will have higher lead gen but it is having the results that gets the

01:21:32	best clients it just is it's your results that sells them yeah um so something that I wanted to I have some notes here that um I have not really reached into but I think a lot of our conversation has been really good and um some of this is more like outside of business but how would you advise someone to get started if they're at zero um so this this is this is the one thing that'll actually change the change the game for you um I'm gonna take short form content agency as an example but you wanna you wanna

01:22:08	produce short form for people you can't sell short form content if you don't do short form content it's it's it's really incredible to me because like I've said this before but people will people will pitch me short form content it's like they don't even do short form content but are you interested in getting more sales with short form content it's like well clearly you aren't why would I trust you to do my short form content if you don't even think you're good enough to do it yourself to do it yourself it's

01:22:43	like what are you what are you doing you have to do the thing yourself or you want to do a YouTube editing agency you wanna you wanna script out videos and and do the editing for people it's like okay well show me something show me some edits like like what do you do oh I've never edited a video before it's like what do you mean what do you mean you've never edited a video it doesn't make any sense if you're if you're trying to sell YouTube editing as a service you should make content related to that and try to

01:23:12	produce clients and and leads from YouTube this works really nice if like you if you're gonna start up a like a legion agency where you send like cold emails or something like that because then you just code email to get Cody email clients and someone gets on the phone like how do I know this works it's like you're on the phone right now it clearly worked on you right so that's obvious right there but if there's no symmetry like that and you're cold dming or cold emailing people to sell them YouTube editing it's like well let me

01:23:39	see some of your YouTube editing you don't have any YouTube editing you're not gonna sell it it doesn't make any sense like it it won't you have to do the thing yeah that's what people don't understand and so like for me I think it's been like a little different right because like I personally am not in the season of life where I'm making short form however when I got started five years ago I was making short form right so are not necessarily short from me it was um igtv at the time and it wasn't

01:24:06	even me it was is like I partnered up with this guy I was like I need to figure this out like I don't really know how this works so I started making videos of him I was like yo like stand here I'm pulling out my camera I got my microphone say this like let's talk about this right so I'm like literally telling him I didn't know what I was doing he didn't know what he was doing but we were just like we were going for it right so we grew an Instagram page from like zero to four thousand followers in like five months just doing

01:24:27	that and then I started posting other videos and this is when I when I learned about Hooks and like learned about how you can capture attention and I started getting super creative with this I was like man like I like I I was getting to the end of my rope right I put out this one video I was like getting mad so I like I reflected that in the title of the video and it was I believe the video was um uh something like when Belfort realizes that Cardone is an idiot and like I was like I liked Grant Cardone

01:24:59	right I like I read his books like I think his 10x rules one of the first books that I read and so like I'm I was just at the end of my rope at this point I'm like I'm just putting this video out I put the video out and I was like the first video that got like almost 100 000 views on Instagram I was like yo what and so the next video I'm like dude I'm I'm getting mad with the hook again so I like put another one out and boom like exact same thing and so like I started to realize and I started getting

01:25:25	creative with it I was like oh like I I did this one it was like from Shark Tank I was like uh it was like about like a shovel or something I was like What if I misspell shovel I'm gonna misspell shovel on purpose and I misspell it and then people are raging in the comment section because I misspelled you yeah literally I just switched to e and l like I wanted to have it be subtle I was like and it was cool because like at that point I think I was um 19 years old and I had started when I was like maybe 16 17. I

01:25:51	started posting when I was like 18. um stuff like that and so I was like 19 years old no I was 17 years old I was 17. yeah so I started when I was like 16 and I was doing all this at like 17. and so at 17 I like I was with some of my buddies and I was like look at this video see this I'm gonna post this and it's gonna get mad views I posted I got mad views so it's like I learned you know through actually doing it yes like we're saying like I did it for myself I took a page from 4 000 to 27 000 followers organically in

01:26:21	six weeks I did it myself I went and I worked for a business grew them from forty thousand to ninety thousand organically and basically did the exact same thing with their revenue monthly from four thousand to ninety thousand because you act actually became good at it and this is why people screw up so how do I make a how do I make a YouTube editing it's like bro you're not good at YouTube editing right now you're not like you've never edited YouTube videos before or whatever you're trying to sell

01:26:45	that bro you're not good at it you're not you have to be good at it by trying things because you figure things out that weren't obvious to you at some point you find nuance and you become hyper skilled at it that's how I got good at Cold email you're selling your wisdom and experience yes yes that's that's what you're you're selling that's what people the YouTube tutorial that's what people want to purchase they want to purchase your experience because they understand that they will have to go through a long period and they'll have

01:27:18	to the the kind of person you sell done for you services to is the kind of person that doesn't want to buy a course they just want it executed right now leveraging your experience they're paying more to have it done quicker yes that's that's how it works they don't want to go to that period of having to do that themselves and if they're like I think this is a great comparison to make right say for example I need to learn something right I can go to YouTube and I can go figure it out maybe it takes me

01:27:43	a week depending on how complex whatever you know thing is maybe it's a year who knows what it is right um now if I can go to someone and I can pay them you know x amount of money to do it for me in a day well that's valuable to me but the thing is it's like you are paying for that person to have gone through that process that you would normally have to go through right so if it takes me a year to go through that process I'm paying you this amount because you went through that process for the entire year and you've

01:28:13	experienced and you have all the knowledge and the wisdom from going through that for an entire year so it's like you are now qualified for me to pay for that one year of experience that you've endured and put yourself through this this is what people like if you if you were at if you were at the beach or something like that you're walking around there's like no water fountains or something like that there's a bunch of people and they're like I'm so thirsty like I forgot water like so I really love a drink right now or

01:28:44	alcohol or something like I order some food I'm so hungry it's like in I don't know it's far off in the middle you we could probably sit there and be like people are like asking for that like they would buy that right now like they would buy that right now you go through you find weird [ __ ] like you you you play around with things like let's say you you go read some Russell Brunson books and you get a free trial to click funnels and you start playing around with click funnels and you start watching some like tutorial videos and

01:29:12	click funnels and you're like um they're like oh what else can I build websites with it's like oh like webflow like yeah you can build on webflow and webflow is pretty complex and you start playing with webflow and then they're like well like you're looking at like the forms or something like that and you you heard and Russell brunson's book about email marketing you're like well like I think webflow looks better but like how would I how would I get like the email submissions from webflow over to like uh this email marketing service

01:29:34	and you're using convertkit or something like that oh you do something like zappy or like oh you can automate stuff like that that's really interesting and say what about like if they're like like call Scheduling over here and then one day you're in a conversation with I don't know some random [ __ ] person you find in the world and they're saying yeah like I run this business I run a I run a med spa or something like that and like our website is like so it's so outdated and like what we really need is

01:29:59	um we just want it to look a lot nicer and we we want the form submissions to like go over here and like go over to this scheduling software and now you're like oh [ __ ] wait like I I like know how to build a website on webflow and I know how to like zap over form submission data to other applications like what's that application you're using oh it's this oh let me look this up real quick oh yeah like you can do that with a web hook on zapier is that going to do that over here near here I can build that for you

01:30:27	like you could do that like yeah like here let me show you some like uh some some like examples and you pull up some like webflow templates like it can look like this back home oh wow that would be amazing yeah I'd love it if you can do that like how much how much do you charge and you're probably like uh like what what what the last guy do it for it's like oh yeah this is like four years ago we paid him um we paid him the ten thousand dollars to do it I'm like oh I can make it look like this for ten

01:30:51	thousand dollars oh okay congrats your [ __ ] relations you just got a client like that it does [ __ ] like that happens only if you know how to do things yeah right so like what people do is they they think they hear we're in a high income skill and sell the high income skill as a service you just learn how to do hella [ __ ] and then like you're in the arena I guess you could say you're on Twitter you're on business Twitter you're watching and there's and there's another piece of that too where it's like it's not even

01:31:21	just the skills that you offer but it's the enjoyment of working with you right so we've signed some people in like the money Twitter space that have been people that would not normally go work with like a short form agency or go work and and I I say that you know we're short from agencies yet but I I say it's a lot more than that like not most short form agencies aren't like flying out to Tampa and shooting in-person podcasts right so I really enjoy the in-person shooting and like um you know being with the person and

01:31:50	and you know taking videos if I have the opportunity to sign someone for you know half or not I wouldn't say that's probably bad you know but if I have the opportunity to sign someone you know that I get to work with in person versus someone that I have to like do stuff with over the phone or like over Zoom whatever like I'm always gonna choose the person in person because like one I get a better feel for them and a better feel for the content that we're going to be putting out and two is just like more enjoyable and like I like

01:32:17	being on set and like shooting it's like I have like all the equipment to do it and like it's just something that I enjoy so you know with that like we've been able to sign some people in the space not because they just want short form but because you know I'm able you know for example um I don't know if I should like name drop but um you know one of one of the clients that that we have he you know yeah like he wanted short form at first he was just like oh like I don't need someone to like just edit short form for me but

01:32:46	then it turned into it's like oh like you can come to the shooting range with me and you can make an entire like you know movie edit of you know me going to the shooting range and you know and then we can turn that into shorts it's like yeah like in fact I would actually love to do that you know picks me up in his G wagon we go to the shooting range and I pull out my red camera and you know literally just shooting a movie for two hours so it's like I for one absolutely enjoy that and two that's way more

01:33:10	valuable to him because you know he can like at the end of the day it's like if you just want your Clips edited yeah you can go find someone on upwork you know to do it for you know a couple dollars a clip right like you can do that and like if that's all you want please go do that because we don't want to work with you different value propositions correct it different people would buy that and then you have other like different subsections of the market so like say say you could like say you were like

01:33:38	outbound prospecting or something like that there's a segment of the people there's a segment of the population who just like don't want to do video yeah like they just don't want to there's a segment of the population who doesn't even know short form is like a big thing there are people exist they're like LinkedIn types or some [ __ ] like that they don't even know short form exists right and you could present it as a new opportunity you could take that angle with that market specifically and then

01:34:05	there's another Market who knows short form exists and they and in that they just they just don't want to be on video they're not ready to do that I was like that at some point for two years I wasn't on video I wasn't on YouTube I wasn't doing it for a long time that was me and then there's people who know like video is good but they don't even know that like there's people that exist that would fly out to them or do that or like get them on a Riverside interview yeah there's just different sections of the

01:34:35	population it's very interesting to me because you can be on Twitter and you can have all these guys spending up these stupid auto DMS where it's like hey are you interested in growing your business with short form content it's like bro you're trying to sell short form content to the single most sophisticated market for that offer of all time if you go start prospecting short form content as a way for like a a two times founder who exited his business and like just published a New York Times bestseller and he's on LinkedIn and you

01:35:05	and you go to him you tell him hey I could fly out to you and like record videos with you you can post them on Tick Tock and and Instagram and YouTube and get millions of views and spread your message he's like wow that's actually really interesting like I can that's a thing like you can do that and the cool thing about that too is like yes Twitter is literally the most sophisticated it's like we have clients and it's like this is something that's still new to me right we'll give them a video I'm like this is a banger video

01:35:35	and they're like yeah I can change this this and this I'm like what like I've you know Twitter like signing clients from Twitter is the only place where I've had people that like we've made a banger video for and they've like you know been like oh yeah like I want like you know all these changes to it like yeah obviously like if you're doing like a big project it's like oh yeah like you know say I'm shooting a wedding video yeah I can't change that like that's one thing but like in a short form piece of

01:35:58	content like I've never experienced that before where it's like you know some people um you know that we that we sign it's like they're just happy that a video is on their feed that is you know has like some text on it and their face behind it right so like obviously that's like less sophistication so it's like if you I don't know if this is like necessarily a bad thing I would love to hear your take on it because I don't view it as like taking advantage of someone because at the end of the day like I I think

01:36:24	that some people they over complicate it and like they have this they set this super high expectation um we have a client now where it's like I'll send them a video and it's like the video is like very polished off and then they'll be like oh no no I don't like this like change the animation here it's like I think it's higher Roi for you to just put out this video and then let's make the changes on the next yeah yeah so what what you have to do is like if you're doing something specific and they're saying like I want this change

01:36:50	would you like counter with is like so I under like what you want to do like the reason why I did this because I know you want this end goal and over here like the function of this video is for like to to to get cold people now like I know I know it's like be distributed and get find new people to follow you we are also gonna make other videos that more so just are for people who already follow you and are aware of you and you're like explaining stuff like that and now like I can give you a a for

01:37:18	instance you have to be able to explain context like this to people and reasonings for them so I'll give you for instance there's this one guy who's like he came to my music bro your like YouTube videos aren't good I can make them better and I'm like and I'm like like show me what you've done he's like showing me stuff from like I don't know like Gamers and just like random [ __ ] and I'm like that and and what I was trying to explain to him is there was a fundamental I didn't even explain until I just

01:37:48	thought it I just didn't reply to him because I just didn't feel like explaining it so but but what I was thinking was that there's a fundamental difference between the kinds of things you've been doing on YouTube and like like this hypey video and like Mass Market entertainment I'm not making videos to entertain people I'm making videos to convey value convey competence and get people to buy my [ __ ] like that's what I'm trying to do I don't need to post video it doesn't make any I don't want the mass market and the

01:38:25	best way it's like with someone like that it's like if you're gonna be editing videos for someone or like you know anything that's like um you know it's multiple thousands of dollars per month in a retainer right if you are like prospecting it's like okay like there's this big person in the space take one of their videos edit it a piece of it hey I can do this to your videos and send that to them and make it super super easy right if I was like hey Daniel like I have this like super cool YouTube editing style that I

01:38:57	think is gonna crush it here it is and I send it to you it's literally a loom video you click it and you're watching yourself in the edited form right away the likelihood of you first of all just responding is going to be so much higher because the result is there right people have to realize that people at a higher level it's like they only have so much bandwidth in the day and they don't have bandwidth for you and your laziness right so it's like there you get to a certain point in Revenue where it's like you know like you said

01:39:29	like it's done for you they want it to be like so from the beginning of you presenting to all the way through you know you fulfilling them it all has to be that done for you right and I think a lot of people they they kind of get stuck in this Frame of Mind where it's like oh I'm presenting this you know done for you offer but you know the the pitch is not done for you it's like that has to be done for you too right hey like you know go check out my video here like that's not done for you like here

01:39:56	this is yours that's done for you yes right like show them the service that you're going to provide yeah yeah yeah so this is when you start prospecting to like a higher end of a of a market like that you need to do things like that and another note to make is that sometimes you're prospecting to like high value prospects and um this happens a lot and it's kind of it it'll happen specifically in this instance so I'll get people pitching me like hey like can I like I can edit your YouTube videos and it's like I have a

01:40:25	YouTube editor like I I have an editor and then what they're trying to do is like they fundamentally don't understand I'm like you're the only way that you're gonna sign me for your YouTube editing is if it is so clearly 100 obvious that you are the absolute way better option and the only way you could do that is if you were to show a very clear end to end I worked with someone who is basically an exact replication of you from here and brought them here if you can't show that to me like and I mean it

01:41:12	was someone exactly like me you will not Scout me from my current editor it will not happen there's zero situation you might be able to get away with some kind of augmentation on their current provider where it's like hey what about like would you like edits like this or something like that you might be able to sell me like a like a thumbnail service or something like if your thumbnails actually are good but this is what's so funny with a lot of people too um you should do like free work in the

01:41:43	beginning if you don't have a ton of clients and like an example of that is like thumbnails or like edited shorts and something like that but I've had people do this to me like free work of that person not just like oh there's something that I've made like that's literally you you make an example you just send it to them I will I will say this every single client that we have worked for for free and attempt to sign them we have signed yeah it's it's yeah it's it's at scale it'll normally be like a 10 15 purchase conversion rate

01:42:14	like literally that high like it's actually that high it's insane however people have done this to me and their work is [ __ ] it's just garbage yeah people have sent me thumbnails like bro this looks like a [ __ ] [ __ ] this doesn't look good at all and they'll send me like shorts or something like that and it's just like this is garbage yes good in context one of the couple clients that we like worked for for free we made like we shot the like I shot the video with you know the cameras recording you and not the

01:42:47	one that people are viewing this on a different one for shorts um I shot the video with him in person we edited the video and then he posted the video and then that video got 1.1 million views and he grew from under a thousand followers and he's now at like 45 000 followers now from that video alone is like 25 20 25 000 followers so it's like yes we did the work for free and we got him results for free too right it wasn't just like oh like I pulled out my iPhone and made this you know video with you know oh yes there's

01:43:18	a time and place for that but it's like as a service that we are selling it's like there has to be a level of professionality right so the other client that I you know really wanted to work with I made him videos and when he posted those videos right he posted those videos they were good enough that he posted those on his feed that he has been curating for 10 years he posted those videos and they performed well and because of that he was like I want to work with you and I I really do not see a scenario where if we are sending

01:43:46	someone videos and those videos are performing they do not work with us yeah that's I mean that's that's 100 of the case if you you have zero clients and you're doing like free work and no one's signing with you it's because your free work is next like your [ __ ] it's not good like it it actually just isn't good and this goes back to the fact where it's like do it yourself you are your first case study every single person has one free client that takes zero effort to acquire it is yourself right and it doesn't have to be

01:44:22	a direct one to one thing you did this by growing like a theme page and like doing [ __ ] like that and figuring out like that I built a portfolio of like what I'm capable of add a port Folia results yeah with and it worked it delivered X specific result like it just did like when I when I met up with that like I grew that theme page and then I the the first client that I like ever got um one I pitched them at a low price I did an entire day of shooting editing and everything for him for free before I

01:44:53	even pitched I didn't even pitch him anything I just went and I filmed with him for an entire day and gave him everything and then the next time after I filmed an entire day then I pitched him I pitched him a a lower number and I also came into that knowing that okay like I had a conversation with him he's like I'm making money but I don't have the reach I want I want more reach because I know that like he had a system in place to make money if he had more reach and I showed I literally pulled out my phone I was like here's my

01:45:22	Instagram I reached 1 million people in the last seven days like you can see it in the Instagram analytics and he's like if I had that I would make a lot more money so that's exactly what we did is like I started working with him and I made him videos expanded his reach and what did he do in the first 30 days he more than did he did more than 100 Revenue increase so it's like you know my portfolio was okay yeah maybe it wasn't like a short form video that I created but it was you know theme page

01:45:53	videos and it's like hear the results for the last you know however many days of the video the content that I've been putting out it's so simple it is like it really it really is so simple just get results yeah you just you gotta actually go to the thing that's pretty much it it's just it's that's that's why I'll say sometimes oh it's gonna take you like six months to sign your first client the function of the six months is not you prospecting for six months it's you becoming actually good at the thing for

01:46:22	six months correct that's what takes all of the time correct it's just getting good at the thing and like you know we we had a client and they were a big client and we had to like pretty much fully refund them because um because they were a bigger client they wanted that guarantee and you know so we gave them that guarantee and we couldn't fulfill on that and the way that we would have liked to now um there were there was poor communication on our end when it came to the type of content that they wanted so

01:46:52	they wanted like super Niche down content and you know we tried to shoot some content that would you know perform and they're like yeah we don't want that I'm like okay this is a problem so it basically got to the point where it's like yeah like this guarantee is never gonna get hit because you know we are not able to um put out the content that would get you to that guarantee so it's like we had to refund them but um you know scenarios like that happen but you know kind of where I was going with

01:47:21	that is you know it's like every client is going to be different and you know you you have to understand what you're capable of and if you're not capable of something like you just have to say oh look I'm not I can't do this yeah yeah so it goes back to like what we were talking about earlier oh you want this result what is required to hit that result and if you aren't competent if you've never done it before you don't know what is required to hit that specific result they told you they wanted so if you

01:47:55	haven't done this before and you don't know how to get such result you'll just have no idea what is required this is the point this is why I'm telling people if you're trying to sell something you need to go do it yourself so that you can discover what is required and when you know what is required that is your competitive advantage that is what gives you that hyper-specific knowledge you have to go through that period of acquiring that unknown knowledge that not many people know because that knowledge the facilitation of that

01:48:33	knowledge is what people buy when they buy Services if you don't have knowledge that people don't know they just won't pay you very simple I want to cover two more things briefly so one how have like your your values or have they shifted at all in the last couple years of business from you know when you got started maybe when you're like 21 22 23 to where they are now um yeah so in the beginning it was kind of just like in the very beginning it's like replace your job like I don't I don't have a job

01:49:10	and then it turns into um and then there was a period where it's just chasing all-time highs I still kind of do that where it's like because you get this dopamine Rush when you hit an all-time high and it it feels so good every time you hit an all-time high and then like if you don't hit an all-time high for a really long time it's like you get like frantic it's like you're a drug addict you're like I need it like you get psychopathically obsessed with this I need to break the record and you just

01:49:36	keep going and going and going um but really kind of like over I'd say maybe like the past six months I've shifted towards like be in business for a really long time like 10 years like 20 years like be in business for a very very long time and just you can't and just grow very consistently I'm not trying to double next month I'm trying to very very gradually over time go up and up could grow quarter over quarter quarter over quarter growth quarter over quarter growth continue and just just do it like

01:50:11	that and just stay just be in business for a long long time that's how you kind of have to fundamentally shift and if you start thinking like that from the beginning you actually do way better and you have a lot more patience and then I think you probably if you think like that it's like oh how can I get the system in place for this to last three years how can I get this foundation in place so that you know I can build on this for the next three years whereas if it's like I'm just like doing this like I don't

01:50:38	like you said I don't know if I'm gonna be in business for a year you're going to take shortcuts that you shouldn't have taken and you know I think this is true across the board and literally everything you do um not even just business right in trading and sports and relationships it's like how can I enter into this and play the long game because your decision making is going to be very different your mind you have to shift to long game like you really think of it on a very extended time Horizon that's what you

01:51:04	have to do it's it's the only way and you can only win if you do that but that's the only way you win is if you take very long time Horizons awesome and then the last thing we're still recording so we'll keep going the last thing that I wanted to wrap up with is how has your faith tied into business and life recently um so like I was I was raised Catholic Christian so like I was baptized I have my confirmation everything like that um but I always didn't like I went to like the church school like on Sundays and and when I

01:51:39	was Wednesdays or something like that and it always just like I was just never interested they never made it interesting I was like this like sucks and then I went through like a really long period where I was kind of like agonostic I guess you could say and then like I'm on Twitter and people were talking about like like praise God Like Jesus is Lord and it's kind of like and they were making it like sound cool it was it was a cool to have faith and I was like let me let me just pick up let me just buy a Bible

01:52:08	and like start reading the Bible and I start reading the Bible like word for word actually pick up the Bible and read it because like so many Christians Catherines you just haven't actually even picked it up in Reddit word for word you've only just listened to what a like a priest or sermon guys told you you read it and you're like holy [ __ ] this is crazy like this is some this is some wild [ __ ] happening in here where it's like yeah so angels fall down or God God makes humans angels fall down they mate

01:52:36	with humans they make Nephilim and the Nephilim God doesn't like them any [ __ ] annihilates them off the face of the planet by drowning them and it's like just wild stuff bro and then like like the description of angels it's like spinning wheels with eyes all over it and like that and then like I remember seeing this for the first time like pictures online where it's like what people think angels are What Angels actually are it's like he's crazy looking beings and I'm like dude what the [ __ ] and I start like buying other

01:53:05	stuff in him um look I guess like spirituality type stuff and then it kind of like you kind of like morph it into like science and what else what is heaven is heaven actually just like a dimension up or it's like and then you just like I think it's called Kundalini oil or something like that because something that excretes from your pineal gland and it goes down your spine and then back up and it takes 33 days to do so and then it's three days it's dark and then like on the end of the third day like ignites your brains

01:53:35	like oh that's pretty interesting because Christ yeah 30 dead for three days and then like comes to life and it's like oh that's a weird Cemetery yeah symmetries between everything and then you look at like you look at like and they say things like like everything repeats and then you look at like stories in the Bible and I feel like it's it's almost as if like stories in the Bible are just like situations with which you will experience in life because every single thing repeats in some fashion where it's

01:54:08	like it has the same theme behind it and then it's I don't know I I I feel like if you start to respect it and like you you kind of just start to operate with like a a more of a respect for for like the world and its nature and try to operate off like a like a like a level of divinity and you feel like and you start Divine yeah and you start to to see too how like everything is so connected like yeah you know all the the stories kind of lead up to you know Christ being born in his story and you

01:54:41	know how the Bible starts off with a marriage between Adam and Eve and then it ends with you know us and you know being the bride of Christ and the bride so it's like it it starts with a marriage and ends with the marriage and um you know just shows like the importance of marriage to God so um everything's like a cycle and then you can take a look at it like business Cycles yeah it's the same thing everything repeats if you just start paying to everything repeats over and over and over again and it's like people

01:55:07	say like uh you you'll you'll you'll be given a challenge until you like understand the lesson and it's like you start to see like things like that and you just start to see the symmetries between every everything you respect it you're like oh okay and you see how God is like you know given people challenges because they're not ready for something you overcome the challenge you are rewarded and then you are presented the next level of challenge correct and you'll keep facing that challenge until

01:55:33	you learn the lesson and then you go higher and you ascend you literally just ascend it's super crazy you just have a you have a better respect for life and you look at things differently 100 and it's like you know your your moral compass is also like different like I feel like if you are just like an atheist and don't believe in God it's like where are you pulling your moral compass from society because you know that's not not super great in 2023 so um you know for me uh you know I did I've done podcasts with you know fellow

01:56:06	Christians I've done um with people of the the Muslim faith and just both it's like I just have a much higher respect for because one they believe in something even people just believe in karma itself oh I'm spiritual and you just believe in karma but even if you believe in that like your moral compass is just gonna be better yeah so correct um you know it's just like those are the I would much rather be around people that have that like for some people they just operate like you're being judged yeah you're being judged

01:56:34	you're being watched not like watched but you were being judged yeah like what there's a consequence for your your actions yeah what you are putting out into the world slingshots back to you and it actually that is real what you put out into the frequency you exert gets pulled back to you everything you do comes around yeah and there's there's consequences for your actions it even just it tied into things like physics if push this there's an equal and opposite it pushes back quite literally Karma but if you think

01:57:08	about like your actions it's just a different dimension of it it's just a different dimension of that occurring there's an equal and opposite Force exactly what you put in is exactly what gets back out 100 percent oh cool with that we are right around the two hour mark so um joint client Ascension joint client Ascension and uh if you need short form content check us out as well links will be in the description appreciate you good pod
